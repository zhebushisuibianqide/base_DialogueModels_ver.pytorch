what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ?__eou__sure . why don ’ t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there .

on the contrary , i have been reading a lot of books about the subject . __eou__oh yeah ? tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?
well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly . yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__ok . anything else ?
well , it 's true i 've never driven two hours just to get lunch . but really , i think it 's worth it . __eou__i think if you try some more authentic chinese food , you might understand how we students from taiwan suffer . 
no way !__eou__what do you mean ?
we 're going up to the " new " chinatown for dinner . i already know where we 're going to go . __eou__alright , alright . i am happy to try more chinese food . will it be dim sum again ?

furnished . parking included . $ 400 . __eou__it 's still pretty expensive . 
here 's the number , 256-4367 . __eou__got it . let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . 
i suppose i don't want that one then . i don't like auto-reverse . it breaks too easily . __eou__really ? have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
yes , twice now . i think it 's too high-tech , and so it 's the first part that breaks . __eou__hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?
hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?__eou__well . no , i didn't clean it . but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i don't trust auto-reverse . 
alright . well . we have many units without auto-reverse . here is a good unit . very reliable . it has an am / fm band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse . __eou__how much is it ?
of course . __eou__it sounds great . i 'll take it . 
ok . i ’ ll take it . __eou__where would you like to sit ?
no , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . oh , and make it thin crust . __eou__okay , thin crust . your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !
that one is one hundred and fifty dollars . __eou__one hundred and fifty dollars ? what about this other one over here ?
hmm . . . that ’ s a bit out of my price range . can you give me a better deal ?__eou__this is an exclusive design by marco ! it ’ s a bargain at that price . 
mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?__eou__sorry , i won't . i 'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation . 
my sister already gave him one . i like something unusual . __eou__this gift is the best for a man who has everything . 
well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . it ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . __eou__taxi ! ! !
well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . besides , you should let old people on first . __eou__sorry . 
i wanted to see the white house . __eou__oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . it goes to georgetown . 
oh , no . __eou__it ’ s all right , though . just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a . 
is that a danish machine ? the name looks danish . __eou__no . it ’ s swedish . would you like me to demonstrate it for you ?
johnny , i wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . haven ’ t you a tongue ?__eou__yes , mother , but my arm is longer . 
fifteen minutes ? i ’ m sorry , but i ’ ll have to call back . i need to get back to work . __eou__o . k . mr . smith . thanks for calling . 
where ’ s the wagon ?__eou__where ’ s what wagon ?
what water wagon ?__eou__the wagon with the water , of course . 
please , i promise this is the last time . __eou__ok , i 'll iron your shirt for you , but only if you make me a cup of coffee . 
hello . i need to disconnect my phone , please . __eou__all right . where do you live , sir ?
i'm afraid not . __eou__then i have to call another taxi , or i 'll be late . 
good morning , ms chan . what can i get you today ?__eou__good morning , mr . church . i ’ d like some lamb chops for the children ’ s lunch . 
would you like to choose a chicken ?__eou__which one is cheaper ?
well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ?__eou__mom ! ! ! please . all my friends have had it for years . 
hello . mr . higgins , please . __eou__he just stepped out . can i take a message ?
b as in boy . you should get off at the last stop in chinatown . __eou__oh , you mean canal street ?
well , dear , we can't force him to go to college . it 's up to him . __eou__i know that but he has to learn to be independent . he can't just keep living at home . 
i have been washing the dishes for over a week now . __eou__well , i think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week . 
i am going to try gado gado . __eou__what 's that ?
it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?__eou__i don't know . i don't know what most of this food is !
certainly , sir . __eou__i'm afraid there has been a mistake . 
well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful . __eou__how much is the rent for the apartment ?
that ’ s what i said when i found out how much the rent was . __eou__congratulations on the new apartment . 
but there 's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . __eou__that 's true , but i love the living room , it 's huge and filled with sunshine . 
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__you are right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . 
you can ask the guests for help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes . __eou__so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food . 
so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food . __eou__italian , indian and chinese . i ’ ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice . 
it is a bit of a fixer-upper . let ’ s take a look inside . __eou__it doesn ’ t look much better inside this place . 
you know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . __eou__there are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy . 
let ’ s go check out the kitchen . the printout says that it is quite large . __eou__look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . 
maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . follow me , please . __eou__what ’ s that smell ?
i 'll give you an application form when i see you . __eou__that sounds good . do i need to bring anything ?
how are you today ?__eou__great , thanks . 
oh , okay . can i do that right now ?__eou__is this friday okay ?
i ’ m fine , thank you . __eou__did you need help with something ?
did you need help with something ?__eou__if i could , i would like to view the apartment sometime today . 
your appointment for friday at 6 pm has been confirmed . __eou__all right . i ’ ll see you on friday . 
you ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . __eou__i understand . may i make an appointment then ?
do you like the apartment ?__eou__i absolutely love the apartment . 
i did not know that . __eou__i assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me . 
that ’ s great . __eou__how much is the rent ?
what about $ 800 ?__eou__that ’ s way too low . 
there are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . __eou__take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . it will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . 
i inform you of the problems . if there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems . __eou__what kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?
what kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?__eou__i found some fairly major problems . a major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist . 
did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ?__eou__the house has a very outdated electrical system . many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . 
if i were you , i would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . __eou__i was thinking that i should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . 
this is he . what can i do for you ?__eou__i'm interested in the apartment on main street . 
i ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . i bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . what do you think of this ?__eou__that looks good . the room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . 
they can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it . __eou__i hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians . 
yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons . of water . ok , i ’ m really to do the meat . should i cook it over a low flame ?__eou__cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . 
that ’ s way too much . __eou__what is good for you ?
how much more are you thinking ?__eou__i can let it go at $ 900 a month . 
can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?__eou__the local newspaper has ads for housing . 
you will have to pay $ 1050 every month . __eou__i can ’ t afford that . 
i can ’ t afford that . __eou__what can you afford ?
i won ’ t go any lower than $ 1050 . __eou__could you please go lower ?
where did you find this apartment ?__eou__i found it in today ’ s apartment ads . 
i'd like to help pitch in with dinner . __eou__really ? you are joking ?
really ? you are joking ?__eou__no , i'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . 
very well , thank you . __eou__please take a seat . everything would be ready in a minute . 
couldn't get connection ?__eou__yes , your number is out of service . 
i don ’ t think we need too much in the way of soft drinks . two super bottles of cola should cover everyone . what about wine ?__eou__just buy a cask of wine . have you bought ice yet ?
i want to skip desert . that all , thank you . __eou__ok , i 'll be with you in a moment . 
come and meet our employees , mr . richards . __eou__thank you , mr . jackson . 
no , not those . the ones on the shelf . __eou__these ?
these ?__eou__yes , please . 
what are you going to do with that vase , penny ?__eou__i ’ m going to put it on this table , sam . 
there we are ! it ’ s a lovely vase . __eou__those flowers are lovely , too . 
i ’ m very well , thank you . and you ?__eou__i ’ m fine , thanks . how is tony ?
this one ?__eou__yes , please . 
what kind of a car do you have ?__eou__an old one . 
i know it 's old , but what make is it ?__eou__it 's a chevrolet . why do you ask ? you going into the car business ?
it 's a coupe with a vinyl roof . __eou__does it have automatic transmission ? . 
this bloody computer !__eou__what seems to be the problem ?
did you end up losing any of your work ?__eou__fortunately , i saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be ok . 
me , too . __eou__buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . 
how much time do primary school students usually spend at school every day ?__eou__kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day . 
do students have to wear uniforms in schools in america ?__eou__some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't . 
i want to buy some running shoes . maybe new balance . __eou__why do you need running shoes ? you aren't a runner . 
that 's not the same . maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . __eou__what 's the difference ?
i really think you are stubborn about some things . but here . let 's look at the new balance shoes . __eou__here it is . this is what my sister has . 
what do you think ? does it taste good ?__eou__it 's absolutely delicious ! that is the best tiramisu i 've ever had !
but we should get you some shirts while we 're here . you need summer shirts . __eou__i would rather buy them somewhere else . 
what about these shirts ? do you see anything you like ?__eou__the styles here are too boring for me . i told you . i like street shopping . 
could you tell me now some of the things i need to do ?__eou__of course . first , you must sand the furniture . you sand it to make the wood smooth . you start with heavy-grade sandpaper . then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . 
our foundation is very high quality . only the finest ingredients . it will moisturize your skin and it has a sun block rating of 8 . __eou__what colors do you have in foundation ?
well , he was very good to me . he helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . so i want to spend at least 75 dollars . __eou__alright , i have an idea . you know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . 
well , he isn't a lawyer , so i don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . __eou__what should he have then ?
i think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . but more like a workbag or shoulder bag . you know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . __eou__i think that 's a great idea . men look great with that kind of bag . where can we buy one ?
i would like to make a suggestion then , sir . __eou__please do . 
for one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better . that ' s because it 's digital . __eou__but isn't it more expensive ?
hello . may i speak to brian , please ?__eou__sorry , you have the wrong number . there ’ s no brian here . 
do you want any sugar ?__eou__yes , please . 
do you want any milk ?__eou__no , thank you . i don't like milk in my coffee . i like black coffee . 
you ’ re working hard , george . what are you doing ?__eou__i ’ m making a bookcase . give me that hammer please , dan . 
i ’ m making a bookcase . give me that hammer please , dan . __eou__which hammer . this one ?
ah yes , i can see it now . where are the cups ?__eou__there are some in the cupboard . can you find them ?
yes . here they are . __eou__hurry up , sam . the kettle ’ s boiling . 
what colour ?__eou__black . 
we need a lot of things this week . i must go to the grocer 's . we haven't got much tea or coffee , and we haven't got any sugar or jam . __eou__what about vegetables ?
give me that piece please , and a pond of meet , too . __eou__do you want a chicken , mrs bird ? they 're very nice . 
what did you say to him ?__eou__i said , this is pauline 's mother . please don ’ t telephone my daughter again !
how much does this house cost ?__eou__6850 pound . 
yes , it 's a macintosh . it 's apple . macintosh and apple are the same thing . __eou__i don't want macintosh . i want pc . 
i need a haircut . __eou__do you have an appointment ?
do you have an appointment ?__eou__no , i don't . you look pretty busy today . do you have an opening for me ?
so i will cut the sides just above the ear . is that good ?__eou__fine . 
of course . i have one i can suggest . __eou__great . i would be happy to try it . i know my hair doesn't look good now . it 's too weak . 
realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__but doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
are you used to the food here ?__eou__i'm not really used to it yet . 
i tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . __eou__you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . if you do , you 'll give your chinese friends quite an impression . 
that 's good to know . i'd like to try more chinese food , but since i can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it 's difficult to try new food . __eou__if you want , i can introduce you to some typical chinese dishes . 
well , as for albert , he should go to an office supply store . there ' s a very good one called office depot . they have everything he will need . and their prices are good too . it 's very convey__eou__can i write that down ?
probably good prices . you know we will only be in america for about a year . __eou__then i suggest you go to k-mart or wal-mart . 
what are those stores ?__eou__they are very large , discount department stores . that means their prices are very good . and you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . 
how much is the membership fee ?__eou__i'm not sure . but if you are only going to stay a year , i don't think price club is good to join . they have great deals occasionally . they are very good for people who like to buy new things all
i just bought these slacks a week ago . and i am a regular customer here . can you make an exception this time ?__eou__well . let me talk to the manager for a moment . ma ' am , the manager says i can do it this time . 
here it is . __eou__i will have to give you store credit , ma'am . if you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . 
i was just wondering if many chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . __eou__in most cities in china , doggie bags are quite uncommon . 
did you like them ? you could take the last one home with you . __eou__that 's ok . i 'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough !
do you make a lot of traditional british food ?__eou__aside from the sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . 
the professor is a bit boring today . you need something to perk yourself up . how about a coffee ?__eou__i don't really like coffee , to be honest . it 's too bitter for me . 
i don't care for coke . i heard that coke was first used as a medicine and i don't like medicine . what else has caffeine ?__eou__maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . 
that 's perfect ! would you like one , too ? my treat . __eou__thanks , but i 'll stick with some jasmine tea . i'm trying to watch my diet . 
i was going to eat in , i'm short on cash . __eou__don't worry about it . it ' s on me . 
i'm starving . let 's go grab a bite . __eou__where to ?
same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . __eou__i guess it is a little pricy . 
and the bubble wrap ?__eou__that ’ s another quid . 
i know what she would like---some whitening cream . __eou__no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . 
that ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__if i were you , i ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . if you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . 
if i were you , i ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . if you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__it ’ s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
that ’ d be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ?__eou__sure , i ’ ll just go put the kettle on . why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and i ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . 
you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?__eou__no , i thought that would be included in the rent . 
oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !__eou__ok , ok , how about we just go dutch ? it 's settled . listen , i'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
i'm really sorry , ethan . i tried so hard , but i'm afraid i could't find a dutch restaurant in town . the best i could do was a german one about 15 minutes from here . __eou__what ? i don't understand . 
do you have any money ?__eou__for what ?
mon and i got in another fight , boris . __eou__oh , iris ! what was it about this time ?
how do you manage it ?__eou__it 's pretty simple , iris . just keep it in mind that you 're what you eat . 
probably , iris . that must be the job of nutritionists . __eou__healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . so we are free to have whatever foods we love . it is unbelievable . 
wow , the duck looks so delicious . should we order it , rick ?__eou__the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . there will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . 
it sounds really complicated . no wonder it tastes so great . __eou__yes , amy , please have some more . 
i know that . __eou__then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . 
then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . __eou__i'm not sure . 
when will we know if they accept the offer ?__eou__the owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . 
which way do you want me to go ?__eou__take a left . 
i already know all of them . __eou__when would you like me to start teaching you ?
what do you need my id for ?__eou__we have to know that this ticket is really yours . 
i am not sleepy . __eou__it 's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow . 
what if i stay up and do something , until i get tired ?__eou__you 'll be up all night if i let you do that . 
that 's true . my bad for not calling . __eou__if you do this again , don't even bother coming home . 
a double cheeseburger sounds good . __eou__everything on it ?
will that be all ?__eou__yeah , that 's it . thank you . 
yeah , that 's it . thank you . __eou__your total comes to $ 5 . 48 . 
this is true , but it must 've slipped my mind . __eou__regardless , all you had to do was give a call . 
do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ?__eou__no salt , please . 
i do all the cooking . __eou__your food tastes so much better than mine . 
your food tastes so much better than mine . __eou__save it . if you want something to eat , then make it yourself . 
oh please , you need to cook tonight . __eou__so you 're telling me that you want me to make dinner ?
i don't have any money to buy you a burrito . __eou__please ? i haven't eaten anything all day . 
please ? i haven't eaten anything all day . __eou__look , i only have money to buy myself a burrito . 
i'm hungry . __eou__so am i . 
how about we go eat in the cafeteria ?__eou__i never bought food from the cafeteria . 
if you can , could you pick up my prescription for me ?__eou__sure , no problem . is your prescription ready ?
i'm starving , as i didn't eat yet today . __eou__i really don't have enough money . 
well , why don't you ask bob for some money ? i'm hungry too . __eou__i 'll be getting money on friday , and i 'll get it back to you then . 
where did you want to go for lunch ?__eou__i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria . 
i don't think i ever got food from the cafeteria . __eou__i actually like the food there . 
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it tasted great . __eou__we can eat at the cafeteria . 
i have a taste for chinese food . __eou__they have really good chow mein . 
i want something sweet after dinner . __eou__what do you have in mind ?
i want to get a snack at the cafeteria . __eou__what are you going to buy ?
the cafeteria doesn't sell kit kats . __eou__then i guess i 'll just get a snickers . 
i haven't shopped there . how is the food ?__eou__the food there is wonderful . 
the food there is a great step up from sons . __eou__thanks for letting me know . 
so , are you still going to have cereal ?__eou__i think i'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast . 
what do i do after that ?__eou__then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce . 
i changed my diet recently , and i eat a lot healthier now . __eou__what do you eat ?
that sounds delicious and nutritious . __eou__you should try it . you won't be disappointed . 
is there a big selection of organic foods at whole foods ?__eou__they have lots of healthier food at whole foods . 
i haven't been shopping there , but maybe i 'll try it sometime . __eou__whole foods is way better than sons , trust me .

i just have some cereal each morning . __eou__you 're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast .

see , i had a burger for lunch yesterday . __eou__think of something . 
if you plan on eating , you are . __eou__what am i supposed to cook ?
i don't know . __eou__you can always make a sandwich . 
i'm not sure . __eou__i can tell you what kind i like . 
i honestly don't know . __eou__did you want to know my favorite kind of pie ?
i would like everything on it , thank you . __eou__do you want any fries ?
how do you want it ?__eou__what do you mean ?
you should throw some corn on the grill . __eou__is that really what you want ?

how are the clubs different in japan than in london ?__eou__well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . in london it 's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .

let me take a look . maybe i can figure it out . __eou__thanks . i really appreciate it .

i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays . __eou__oh , my god ! john , i didn ’ t know you are religious . you just look like a scientific kook , like leonard in the big bang theory . 
yes , they are compatible . actually , the u . s . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__i 've heard about it a little bit before , but i don ’ t understand . how can people believe in god since they know god doesn't exist ?
really ?__eou__absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england . 
because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans . __eou__how come ? i mean why most of them were religious people ?
why did they want to found a college ?__eou__many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . 
when did it begin to be called harvard university ?__eou__in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman .

it 's nothing . i'm just a little stressed out . __eou__why ? what 's stressing you out ?
what are you going to play ?__eou__some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . 
and i can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__yes , it 's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . those who practise calligraphy and qigong always live longer .

any other requirements ?__eou__phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . you should know how to use them . 
should we remember all the new words and expressions ?__eou__certainly . 
the job market is so competitive nowadays . i want to develop some useful skills . __eou__i really admire you for that . how is it going ?
yes , but i think it ’ s probably for the best . __eou__won ’ t you get lonely ?
i ’ m not sure . what ’ s the difference between them ?__eou__public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .

good . i recommend it . shakespeare is of course enormously important . we want our students to take the class as soon as they can . and professor friedman is an excellent teacher . __eou__i 'll take it then . 
tell me , lisa , what made you decide to be an english major ?__eou__i want to be an english professor in the future . i love studying literature , and i want to teach it . 
well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . why don't we flip a coin for it ?__eou__alright . do you have a coin ?
thanks . i really appreciate it . in fact , i do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . __eou__what kind of scholarship is it ?
it 's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the american minority students scholarship association . i'm eligible for it because i'm asian american . __eou__fine . i know about that scholarship . you have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3 . 7 or higher . 
excellent . so you 'll have a good chance of getting it . __eou__well , i hope so . the competition is probably pretty heavy . and they want a writing sample too . 
i came here today to talk to you because . . . well , i need to ask two favors . __eou__sure . what are they ?
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful . __eou__can i check this one out ?
excuse me . do you study chinese at the university here ?__eou__yes , i do . but my characters are very bad . 
they teach regular characters . __eou__i see . i'm from taiwan , so i know regular characters better than simplified . 
you mean you and i ?__eou__yes , why not ? i mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice chinese and english .

what do you mean ?__eou__i mean in the library , or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . 
but i need a pretty decent job . i need to make enough to pay my rent at least . __eou__i have an idea . 
since you 're chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in chinatown . __eou__i already had that idea . 
i will ask my friends for you . maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people . that ' s another thing you should do . ask all your friends to ask around for you . you might find something . __eou__i have to find something . otherwise i have to go back to taiwan . i 'll be broke in two months . 
i 've heard about it , but i don't really know about it . __eou__the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school . it gives you discounts on all kinds of things . movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . 
whoa ! that 's expensive ! it should be cheaper . __eou__but think of how much money you 'll save ! you can use it for a year . 
i didn't see you at mr . johnson 's class today . __eou__yeah , i quit .

if you give me your address , i can mail you an information packet and the application forms . __eou__great !
have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ?__eou__no . prof . grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . for once i wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . 
i am , but there is too much material to cover . i ’ ll be writing forever , and grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__so they limit it to one region of mexico . say the yucatan . you ’ ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . 
i am , sir . __eou__please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in english . very well ! whose turn is it to have a free talk ?
please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in english . very well ! whose turn is it to have a free talk ?__eou__it 's me , sir . but i am sorry i have forgotten to prepare for it .

when is it due ?__eou__next monday . 
next monday . __eou__remind me never to sign up for that course .

oh yeah ! almost forgot ! i need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . __eou__wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! okay , here you go . you are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . 
good idea . we should also hold a series of presentations . we could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . __eou__good idea ! i think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . 
of course i do !__eou__which class are you working on right now ?

do you mind if i ask you why you 've taken the part-time job here ?__eou__of course not . you know , there are many foreign customers like you here . and i think it 's good for me to improve my oral english .

that depends . some semesters have many , some don't . and some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . that 's easy . __eou__and when do you prepare for your final exam ?
really ? you only review your lessons in one month ? does it work ?__eou__of course , it 's useful . and it 's very crucial to have the copies of teacher 's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them .

that 's right , quite different . one day one of my american friend looked pale , so i asked him whether he was sick or not . but he was reluctant to answer my question . __eou__that 's weird . 
sure , i 've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . why ?__eou__well , i had a meeting today with a woman from japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! i didn't know what to do !
how long have you been in america ?__eou__for more than five years . 
pardon me . could you please pass me the tissue ?__eou__sure , here you are . 
you know , i really don ’ t think americans are very romantic . __eou__where did you get that idea ?
where did you get that idea ?__eou__that ’ s the impression i get from the movies , and from looking around . men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . 
is it true or isn ’ t it ?__eou__do you want to know something about the american character ?
my class is in the c building . __eou__i know where the c building is . 
of course , which room number is it ?__eou__number 261 . 
how are your chinese lessons going ?__eou__oh i ’ m learning very slowly . i think chinese is more difficult than english . 
maybe , but i think people usually learn english more quickly than chinese . __eou__yes , i guess basic speaking in the english is easier . 
yes , i guess basic speaking in the english is easier . __eou__maybe that ’ s why your english is much better than my chinese . 
it 's c261 . __eou__my next class is around there . 
where can i buy textbooks ?__eou__first , you need to have the list of books for your class . do you have that ?

we will return 6 days later on december 8th . will someone be picking you up ?__eou__yes , someone is coming to get me . 
it 's on the second floor . may i join you ?__eou__of course ! let 's go . 
yeah , so far , so good . __eou__next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . make sure they are smooth . 
i hope it works !__eou__well , good luck !

first you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . the dollars have to be smooth . __eou__ok , what next ?
i need to find a space on campus . __eou__why don't you park in the parking structure for students ?
where is the parking structure at ?__eou__it 's on the west side of the campus . 
are you ready to go ?__eou__i'm clear so far . 
that was earlier this morning . __eou__it wouldn't be full right now , would it ?
you seem to have filled the form out all right . are you familiar with our rules and fines ?__eou__yes , i know what to do . 
when i went up there , it wasn't full at all . __eou__when was that ?
would it be full now ?__eou__i am really not sure . 
do you need anything else ?__eou__that ’ s everything . 
what did it say ?__eou__it says the book is on the shelf , but i didn ’ t find it there . 
i can always borrow the book from another library . __eou__you can do that ?
why not ?__eou__it ’ s just a policy of ours . 
that ’ ll be all . __eou__these books are due back in two weeks . 
i want to check these books out . __eou__is that all ?
is that all ?__eou__that ’ s all . 
yes . that ’ s it . __eou__these are due back in two weeks . 
you ’ re not allowed to do that . __eou__i don ’ t understand . 
only books or videos . __eou__i need this magazine . 
i would also like to check out this video . __eou__is that all ?
you will be fined if you damage it . __eou__i understand . thank you very much . 
i wasn't feeling well . __eou__here they are . 
oh , no , this is the rest . __eou__thank you very much . 
thank you very much . __eou__it 's no problem at all . 
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?__eou__yes , i had a teacher like that before . 
that would work , but don't let it happen again . __eou__i 'll try . 
make sure to remind me right before you are absent . __eou__i 'll remember . 
he really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . would that be ok ?__eou__yes , i really need someone who is really good . 
professor , can you help me add your class ?__eou__you have to bring me an add sheet to sign . do you have one ?
no , i will have to get an add sheet . __eou__you must take the signed add slip to the admissions and records office to add the class . do you know where that is ?
you 'll find it easily . make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . __eou__thank you for letting me add your class . 
i have an opening . do you have an add sheet for me to sign ?__eou__yes , i have an add sheet . 
thanks . i understand what to do now . __eou__it should be easy to find . after you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . 
it should be easy to find . after you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . __eou__that sounds good . 
you can't miss it . add the class and then come back . we 'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . __eou__that 's great . thank you so much . 
where do you need to be that is more important than school ?__eou__i have an appointment . 
do you have a plan to make up your missed work ?__eou__no , but i 'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . 
be careful about the time limits on the streets . have you seen the signs for time limits ?__eou__what signs ?
i 'll pay for it with a check . __eou__would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ?
i can understand the problem with that . __eou__is there any way that you can fix my schedule ?
great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ?__eou__i 'll pay cash . 
i attend both day and evening classes . __eou__will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ?
will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ?__eou__i ride a motorcycle . 
no , just the motorcycle permit . __eou__fine , here it is and have a great semester !
i have two classes on here that are at the same time . __eou__oh , i see . 
is it at all possible for you to fix that error ?__eou__yes , i can . would you still like to have both of these classes ?
sure . do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ?__eou__i think that the percentage is incorrect . 
here is the answer sheet . do you see a place where i marked something wrong that should have been right ?__eou__i don't see any mistakes . 
i count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . does this look right to you ?__eou__looks pretty good . 
could we go over some things , because i think my test score is wrong . __eou__what do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ?
both . __eou__i am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . will that work for you ?
ok , let 's do the calculation . __eou__we add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . 
all of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . __eou__does the final count the most ?
i think that i could study a little harder for tests . __eou__fine ! please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . 
okay . i ’ ve signed it . __eou__that ’ s all there is to it . 
how do you decide what grade we get ?__eou__i look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . 
i'm seeing that you are doing ok in some areas , but not so well in others . __eou__i think i could take better notes and read a little more . 
i missed a few classes ; i need to make sure i come to school on a regular basis . __eou__having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ?
could i check out this book ?__eou__let me see your library card . 
i ’ m returning these books . __eou__let me have them . 
i didn ’ t have time to return them . __eou__you ’ re going to have to pay late fees . 
it really isn ’ t . __eou__here you go . 
i didn ’ t know you could do that . __eou__i will call you when i find it . 
is it on the shelf ?__eou__i didn ’ t see it . 
i ’ m going to need your library card . __eou__i have it right here . 
could you reserve a copy for me ?__eou__i can do that . 
i want to get a passport . __eou__you need to apply for a passport . 
is there something wrong ?__eou__i don ’ t see it on the shelf . 
could you do that ?__eou__i ’ ll let you know when i get the book in . 
i do ?__eou__you owe some money . 
how may i help you today ?__eou__i need to make some copies . 
does it cost to use it ?__eou__we do charge to use the machine . 
i need to copy some pages in my book . __eou__the copier is right over there , in the corner .

how much do you charge ?__eou__you need to pay ten cents for every copy . 
i will call you when a computer is free . __eou__how do i log on to the computer ?
do you have your library card with you ?__eou__yes , i have it . 
how ’ s it going ?__eou__i ’ m fine . thank you . 
i am looking for an article in a newspaper . __eou__did you check the periodicals ?
no , not every day . __eou__will the library be open on saturday ?
congratulations ! that 's excellent news ? what do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ?__eou__i have to get an belts score of 7 . 5 overall . do you think i can do that ?
have you ever been denied a visa before ?__eou__never . 
i not only passed my test , but i aced it ! i'm so happy !__eou__you should be . you worked really hard last night preparing for it . 
i am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . when can you re-take your exam ?__eou__tomorrow . 
so , how 's your course going ? do you like it ?__eou__i like my professors and the classes , but it 's a lot of work . 
what kind of program are you looking for ? full-time or part-time ?__eou__i have to work during the day , so i want to find a part-time course that i can do in the evenings . 
do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ?__eou__i think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . 
sure . here 's a brochure about out english classes that meet in the evenings . __eou__thanks . i 'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course . 
just a few years ago . what about you ?__eou__i just graduated from high school .

maybe i could help . __eou__i blew the finally exam . 
don't brother me !__eou__hey , chillon , i'm just trying to help . 
that 's too bad , anyway , i'm sure things will turn around next master . __eou__i'm thinking of dropping out . 
well , i finished my last final today . __eou__the end of all the hard work for my master 's . what a nice feeling to get my degree !
oh , iris , it ’ s about the job with the pr company . __eou__it ’ s a great opportunity . you should be happy with the offer . 
why ? it ’ s unfair . you can learn a lot from it . __eou__she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . it takes so much time and energy that i won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . 
just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . and more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . __eou__do you think it will work ?
do you have a clear career path to follow ?__eou__career path ? i'm not sure . 
sure , i have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__cool ! it must be amazing to work at a bar !
these magazines are interesting . may i borrow one ?__eou__of course . 
hi . i ’ m feeling very nervous . i just had a test and i ’ m not sure how well or how badly i did . __eou__it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . 
let ’ s go and get a coffee together . that will help you to wake up again !__eou__ok . i feel like sitting down and having a chat . how have you been recently ?
let me see . there ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . __eou__what ’ s in that section ?
i ’ m not sure i like the idea of that . i don ’ t want people copying me or other people . it could be very confusing . __eou__according to the article , you have no real need to worry . research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . 
what school would you like to go to ?__eou__i ’ m not sure . 
are you serious ?__eou__i ’ m serious . 
stop running around in front of the tv , will you ? why don't you just sit and watch ?__eou__i 've tried , but i can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
are you all right ?__eou__nyu was my first choice . 
thank you , wendy . i hope you 'll be able to make it to the wedding . __eou__i'm looking forward to it . 
oh , it 's my pleasure . after all , you are very qualified for the position . __eou__thank you very much indeed . you helped me rebuild my self-confidence . 
to be frank , i find philosophy rather boring . __eou__to tell you the truth , it 's the most tedious course i'ever had . 
yes , my customers have started to complain too !__eou__oh look ! here it comes now !
because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . __eou__oh , i see . she told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . 
i feel so uncomfortable . __eou__are you sick ?
he is really terrific !__eou__he was very clever when he was a boy . 
our major is from a bigger city . __eou__he ’ s doing fine . a new broom sweeps clean . 
he ’ s doing fine . a new broom sweeps clean . __eou__he brings with him some talented people from his former city . 
any reasons ?__eou__the cause is another boy . 
you 've done a lot , my darling !__eou__i may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . 
i may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . __eou__you 're too strict with yourself . 
he 's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . __eou__don't you like to know anything about stocks ?
and my new car . to think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . that 's what hurts me most . __eou__what 's so terrible too , is the fools we 've made of ourselves . 
i saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . __eou__i understand that . but i think maybe it 's not a date . you are taking the matter too much to heart . 
didn't joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ?__eou__he has no sense . 
what makes you think so ?__eou__she 's my sister , you know . 
thank you . it has been handed down in my family for three generations . __eou__oh , it is precious . 
okay . let ’ s clear the air . what are you getting at ?__eou__you always have a chip on your shoulder . 
as a teacher , i don ’ t know how to help him . __eou__he is hopeless . 
oh , i'm sorry . __eou__it kept me awake a couple of hours . 
i'm so sorry , i . . i didn't realize it was that loud . __eou__it was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with mary if you don't believe me . 
can you believe i'm going to america ?__eou__that sounds great . 
where did you buy it ?__eou__i bought it in a store near my school . 
ah ! no ! damn it !__eou__it 's a blackout . now i can't see seinfeld . 
congratulations ! is it a boy or a girl ?__eou__it 's a boy . 
shut up !__eou__no , listen to me . perhaps it 's my fault that i treat everybody so well . maybe in other people 's eyes , i want you to be my girl-friend . but . . . but . . . 
thomas , if i could write with the beauty in her eyes , i was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__and , her lips ?
and , her lips ?__eou__her lips ? the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . 
yeah . i'm going to celebrate tonight . wanna hang out ?__eou__sure . it 's on you right ?
i , i don't know how to explain it to you . __eou__go ahead . it 's nothing serious . we are good friends , aren't we ?
yes , she leaves it to me . __eou__as i say it the work is well worth try . after all you can get a higher salary . 
don't hesitate . that 's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__maybe you are right . but the major is not fit for me . i like architecture more than computers . 
are you listening to me , dan ?__eou__i'm with you , jane . 
but i don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do . __eou__you are unfair to her . she is a very nice girl . 
hello , dora , i haven't seen you for a long time . where have you been ?__eou__i didn ’ t go anywhere . i stayed at home . 
i didn ’ t go anywhere . i stayed at home . __eou__what 's up ? you look unhappy . 
what a beautiful sweater !__eou__do you think it looks good on me ?
you won't believe it , but it was really cheap . __eou__i wish i could find one just like it . 
i love that vase . __eou__do you really like it ?
do you really like it ?__eou__yes , it looks perfect . 
alice , i never knew you had such a lovely voice . you really can sing , can't you ?__eou__thanks , mark . i used to be a member of the school choir . 
do you think it fits me ?__eou__yes . it looks terrific !
my warmest congratulations on your entering the oxford university . __eou__i really appreciate your kind words . 
yes . and something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . __eou__sorry . i guess i wasn't thinking . i won't do it again . 
we can't put up with it any more . __eou__we 'll play the cd loud , is that all right ?
that 's an understatement . i'm on cloud nine . i couldn't be any happier . __eou__did you tell your parents yet ?
did you tell your parents yet ?__eou__not yet . i didn't get a hold of them . i 'll try to call them again tonight . 
i 've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . __eou__i'm really sorry . 
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it 's a real letdown . __eou__i don't think she would do such a thing . 
then forgive her mistake . __eou__oh , i just can't forget it . 
thank you . i appreciate the compliment . __eou__your knowledge of english is really surprising . 
you ’ re making my blood boil . __eou__calm down . madam . 
i'm about to explode ! you ’ ve made a mess of this matter . __eou__i am very sorry to hear that you ’ ve been having so many problems . 
i really wanted to get into nyu . __eou__i am really sorry to hear that . 
hey stacy . what 's going on ?__eou__i'm pretty tired these days . 
why ? you 're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?__eou__i have so much house work to do . i have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . 
does the class start again , mam ?__eou__yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . 
are you new here ?__eou__yes , i am . 
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?__eou__yes . i am ready . 
i was at pcc before . __eou__why did you transfer ?
did you like it at pcc ?__eou__pcc is an incredible school . 
pcc is an incredible school . __eou__well , i wish you luck here . 
do you like it here so far ?__eou__i am really enjoying it here so far . 
i started school somewhere else . __eou__what school did you transfer from ?
you ready ?__eou__am i ready for what ?
so , why don ’ t you just stay here ?__eou__that may be what i ’ m going to do . 
you ’ re absolutely right . __eou__do you know what you ’ re going to do now ?
professor , i 've handed in my paper . did you read it ?__eou__yes . you 've done a good job . but there 's one thing . you should narrow down your topic . 
exactly . i had tons of ideas that i wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . what should i have done to get my point across ?__eou__you have to keep things short and sweet . when you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . 
i 've had it with tim ! i think i'm going to quit !__eou__but sandra . . . you love your job ! you spent months trying to get this position . it 's perfect for you !
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?__eou__basically , i think tim is threatened by me . i'm doing a better job than he is so he 's trying to sabotage my career !
oh , no . . . __eou__aren't they cool ? i like the settings . 
it 's a little eerie . i'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . __eou__well , i think it 's fabulous . and the neighbors don't even seem to exist . 
look , i 've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we 're going to finish watching it . __eou__well , give me the walkman . i 'll listen to the music then . 
surely , there are other ways to save money . __eou__what are you talking about , we tried everything !
i don't know . i'm too excited to say a word . __eou__i understand . it 's too good to be true , isn't it ?
so now you can say you had a mafia experience . ha-ha . __eou__yeah . if i leave little italy alive . . . 
yes , ma'am . he died from complications of stomach cancer . i'm very sorry . __eou__i'm really sick !

that 's ok . just let it out . i'm ok ! i was out of town with . . . femi . __eou__oh , taylor ! i'm so . . . so happy . but then . . . who 's that ?

what ? i don't get it . . . __eou__many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . he meant that you turned it into a comedy . 
it 's a little early for those , isn't it ? i still have eight months to go . . . __eou__believe me , the time will fly by ! before you know it , you 'll be changing diapers ! you have to start preparing !
believe me , the time will fly by ! before you know it , you 'll be changing diapers ! you have to start preparing !__eou__i thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . what do you think about lavender ?
please forgive me , but i have to leave . i feel terrible . but . . . __eou__what 's the matter ?
we should come here more often . __eou__you are absolutely right . 
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !__eou__i don ’ t slurp my coffee . and plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?

then my son drove into a tree__eou__i'm sorry to hear that . 
just remember . the main thing right now is to make sure stars . com is happy . __eou__right . you 're right . but she 's just evil . someone should drive a stake through her heart . 
i'm ok . i 'll be fine . i'v cool . i'm cold . i'm like ice . she won't know what hit her . __eou__by the way , how 's the nose ? boy , that must have hurt .

elvin doesn't want any programming help . he wants all the glory for himself . __eou__you might be right . he does think pretty highly of himself . 
what ?__eou__she promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the stars . com web site by the end of next week . 
what he said disappointed me . __eou__what did he say ?
he said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . __eou__it is stupid to say so . 
no . actually i can stay longer . dave called to say that there is a beautiful chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . __eou__oh , that ’ s better . so you don ’ t have to rush . 
my uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . i was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__criminals are clever ? they 're only successful when people are careless .

that ’ s true . for the junior executive room . . . three nights . . . yes , your bill should be $ 1,500__eou__but i definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . 
are you quite sure ?__eou__yes . have a look . 
yes . have a look . __eou__i see . i had no idea our advertising was so misleading . it is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . 
he treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !__eou__do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
they 're incredibly selfish . they ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !__eou__have you ever talked to them about it ?

thanks . we should be ourselves . there are so many fashion victims out there . __eou__yes , but with our sense we 'll always look good .

fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !__eou__i don ’ t slurp my coffee . and plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?

yes , it is . __eou__can you get it ?
why not just give them money in red envelopes ? that would be much easier . __eou__americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . so i have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends .

i'm feeling very sad . i just read the newspaper . __eou__what 's the news ?
yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . __eou__that 's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
flares ?__eou__they 're also known as bell-bottoms . they are a type of trousers . 
it 's too complicated . i 'll just stick to the plain clothes . __eou__that 's fine , but then you 'll always look plain . 
yes , i also felt that . i'm always busy , and have no time for rest . i don ’ t know how to make use of time . __eou__maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . 
then who were they ?__eou__mo mu , thong lichen , meng gang and ran nv . they were well respected . 
i think the supermarket is closed now . __eou__oh , when does it close ?
what are their names ?__eou__jack and stephanie . 
i 'll never hurt you ; i 'll never lie . __eou__my love will grow , like a river to flow . 
how many can we choose ?__eou__the aquamedic pool is included . you can choose three . 
really ?__eou__but the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . 
who has a crush ?__eou__come on , josh , don't be such a chicken . if you like her , you 've got to tell her . maybe she likes you .

oh , dear ! it 's an encroachment on individual rights !__eou__well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . that 's why many people think such rules acceptable . after all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . 
hi , bill . i saw you yesterday with a pretty girl . __eou__yes , she is my favorite girl . i 've decided to go steady with her . 
i don't think so . let 's walk by the stream . i am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . __eou__ok . i have a good pair of hiking boots . it should not be a big problem . 
how do you know ?__eou__because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . 
well . . . how about friday then ?__eou__that sounds fine . 
i know i'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , john ?__eou__honey , we 're in the museum now . we 're not here to discuss your coworker 's love life . we 're here to enjoy the great paintings by picasso !

and i hope so . this is what you were meant for . say you love me , say yes , say yes . __eou__yes . 
you 're probably right . i just wish it were that simple . how can i stop feeling so anxious all the time ?__eou__taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
hello , steven !__eou__how are you doing ?
why ?__eou__i have a lot of work to do in the company recently . 
i'm moblogging !__eou__moblogging ? what does that mean ?
i want you to have a walk with me . __eou__i 'll finish soon . 
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you 'll change your mind . __eou__maybe . after all , i am grown up now .

what about the next day ?__eou__no . i'm busy then too . i'm meeting dorothy heath at north bridge road . are you free on thursday afternoon ?
we 're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face wenchman earthquake . __eou__right . but people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . life is the most important compared with anything else . 
i'm all right , thanks . just a little tired . __eou__late night ?
actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . __eou__addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !
hello , zhang lin ! fancy meeting you here !__eou__hi , lin tao . i have't seen you for some time . 
but anyway , he won at last . __eou__yeah . to win is the most important thing . 
ben cancelled his trip . __eou__how come ?
how is your ankle ?__eou__my what ? oh , that , right as a trivet . 
hello , xu hua . i'm paula . i'm american . __eou__welcome to china , paula .

nice day , isn't it ?__eou__sure it is . why don't we go to a park ?
ok . i 'll try a pinto . i want to rent a car for one week . __eou__all right , sir . may i have your driver 's license ?
i'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . she will worry if i get home late . __eou__what a pity ! the party is very interesting . 
i have no choice . my mother is always very strict with me . __eou__don ’ t complain about it . she is concerned about your safety . 
i'm going to london on business next week . but i know nothing about it . __eou__i get it . you want to find a guide , don ’ t you ?
let me hold the door for you , miss . __eou__thank you . you 're very kind . 
victoria , you are back from vacation ! how was it ?__eou__to tell the truth , i feel tired . 
to tell the truth , i feel tired . __eou__how come ?
no one in the family expected to get a dime from him . it was quite a surprise . __eou__what a lucky man . 
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends , too ?__eou__we used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn ’ t mention to your biological father . 
didn ’ t i tell you ? it ’ s over !__eou__oh , i am sorry to hear that . i did ’ t know that you had split up . what happened ?
what store do you shop at ?__eou__the small one , just down the street . i like their generic brand . 
i have been using the store across town for years . __eou__i hear they have very nice stuff . 
i hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__they do , but they 're a little expensive on certain items . 
well , you should try my store . the prices are good . __eou__i will sometime . thanks for the advice . 
how are you doing , andrew ?__eou__not well . i ’ ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . 
not well . i ’ ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . __eou__but you have so many friends ! how could you be lonely ?
i know you are , you are my girlfriend . i wish i had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . __eou__i know what you mean . i find it difficult to make new friends , too . it ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ?
not at all . __eou__i ’ ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . 
we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa . __eou__you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
you like movies ?__eou__yeah , i think it 's the best way to relax . 
i see . i generally like movies to help calm me down . i think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . 
nothing special . __eou__how about having dinner with me ?
very good . that may be the most delicious food i have ever eaten . __eou__it 's nice of you to say so . 
i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook . __eou__that ’ s great . i'd love to . 
could you lend your bike to me for several days ?__eou__how long would you like to keep it ?
you know what , i 've just got a new job with a computer company . __eou__oh , congratulations !
oh , jack , you deserve it . you ' ve been working so hard . __eou__thank you for saying that . 
hi ! tom . want to go to play bowling tonight ?__eou__sounds good . when and where shall we meet ?
it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? you were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . 
no , not so soon . couldn ’ t i persuade you to stay a couple of days more ?__eou__much as i wish to but i really can ’ t . i 've already booked the flight . 
much as i wish to but i really can ’ t . i 've already booked the flight . __eou__i hope this won ’ t be our last meeting . 
nice to meet you . __eou__pleased to meet you too . and where are you from , robin ?
what did you do this weekend , kate ?__eou__oh , diane and i went for a drive in the country on saturday . 
yes , i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !__eou__good ! julie , if you could pass this plate down to joe , i think we are all set . 
oh , i bet it 's really quiet . but is there much to do there ?__eou__no , not much . in fact , nothing ever really happens . that 's the trouble . 
sorry to hear that . i think it 's even better than on the golden pond . __eou__hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
but she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__don't worry . she will be all right . 
so , did you go out with richard ?__eou__yeah . we went to a movie last saturday . we saw police partners ii . 
richard did , but i didn't . of course , i told him i liked it . __eou__yeah . so did you do anything else ?
did you have fun there ?__eou__yeah , we had a great time . and we 're going to go there again next week !
i'm not feeling too well . i 've caught a cold . __eou__is it because of the bad weather ? it 's been really miserable for the past tew days . 
hasn't it ! it 's been cold and windy recently . do you like the weather here ?__eou__not really , but i 've got used to it now . 
not really , but i 've got used to it now . __eou__oh , i'm going for a trip to new york this autumn . what 's the weather like in new york ?
what ? no kidding !__eou__yes , she 's a professional climber . 
yes , he likes the people and the quietness there . __eou__would you ask him to tell us more about the country ?
he loves that blonde girl . __eou__yes , he once gave her seven roses . 
how upsetting ! he has been away for a week !__eou__i don't know if anything terrible has happened . 
bob 's sister will go to america . __eou__why tell me ? she has nothing to do with me !
why tell me ? she has nothing to do with me !__eou__i thought you wanted to know more about her . 
oh , he 's a very serious person . __eou__you must feel very uneasy at his home . 
have you heard we 'll have a pay rise ?__eou__oh , it has nothing to do with me . 
is it stimulating ?__eou__yes . i got very excited . 
hmm , what i'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__in that case , we can choose the youth hotel . it 's a good choice , clean and economic . 
that 'll be lovely . where are you going ?__eou__well start out from long island this friday . we 've planned a four day drive to salt lake city , where we 'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . 
i liked it . __eou__i 'll give you a speech like that , too . 
i have lots of friends . __eou__really ? how many do you have ?
of course . i have lots of best friends . __eou__how many best friends do you have ?
that 's correct . __eou__so what 's the problem ?
mario puku . __eou__who 're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ?
no . __eou__how do you know ?
if i catch you , you 'll be sorry . __eou__you won't catch me , because i love you . i'm not a cheater . 
i don't want any other woman . __eou__i will chop your toes off , one by one . 
oh ! ! my car isn't working . i'm waiting for a tow-truck . __eou__do you have a ride home ?
does she know how to speak spanish ?__eou__she knows how to speak spanish and japanese . 
what 's that ?__eou__she 's not good at remembering things . we have a date , and she 's an hour late ! !
oh , so you 're from south america . __eou__actually , costa rica isn't in south america . it 's in central america . 
maybe . . . but i don't think so . __eou__really ? what 's the matter ?
i am dying from the heat . __eou__turn on the air conditioner . 
i don't know . __eou__did you call the repairman ?
yes , you are right . but one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . constant learning drive us to sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . __eou__yes , i agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ?
oh , that 's ok . let 's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 . __eou__that sounds fine . 
diana , in your opinion , which is more important , iq or eq ?__eou__why are you asking me the strange question , jerry ?
quite right . have you noticed that a high iq is not a must for one 's success ?__eou__just as forrest ?
is it the same in korea ?__eou__i don't think so . in korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . 
do people get married young ?__eou__not really . very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . 
well , i was born in ohio , but i grew up in texas . __eou__and when did you come to los angeles ?
well , how about tomorrow night ? are you doing anything then ?__eou__no , i'm not . what are you planning to do ?
well , my parents have rented a condominium in florida . i'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . __eou__sounds great !
brian ! how have you been ?__eou__pretty good . say , you 've really changed !
i'm doing really well . i got married about three years ago . i have two kids now . __eou__that 's terrific !
great . how long were you away ?__eou__i was there for about three weeks . 
yes , most of the time . but it snowed a lot in chicago . __eou__so , what was the best thing about your trip ?
i am so glad that you decided to stop by !__eou__yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you . 
thanks , miss . wang . __eou__you know in china we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 
but for the life , we 'll be changed by this society . __eou__i really don't want to go into the world , i feel afraid of it . 
i would recommend the mall , it 's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . it has a wide range of shops and restaurants . __eou__thank you . also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we 're in town . can you recommend some local attractions ?
excuse me . i don't think we have met before . my name is mary jenson . __eou__oh , hello . i'm bias chettri . 
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . __eou__sounds interesting !
i just can't wait to see them . which one do you choose today ?__eou__what about tianqiao temple fair ? a variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . 
great ! do you know how to get there ?__eou__of course . 
today 's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . __eou__right . so in some way we are happier . 
i don't know how to deal with jack . he is indeed a trouble maker . he has loused up my business several times . __eou__you mean lily 's boyfriend ?
i did , but he gives me a runaround . __eou__if i were you , i would put the whole matter on the table . 
do you hike or fish on your trips ?__eou__yes , both . last trip i fished a little and hiked five miles . 
are you ready to welcome him ?__eou__i am all set . he can come anytime . 
i have found myself a date mate . __eou__you must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . 
not very well . he was white about the gills . __eou__did he see the doctor ?
yeah , it happened a week ago . __eou__that 's a crying shame . it really is !
really ? well , what time does it start ?__eou__it starts at 8
we are putting together a birthday party for mary . __eou__that sounds like fun . where will it be ?
what are you doing this weekend ?__eou__i am not sure . what are you doing ?
i 've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . __eou__that sounds great . is it casual ?
oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . __eou__great ! i 'll look forward to it . we 'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . 
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i don't like it in winter . __eou__why ?
good ! i am really thirsty . you know it really is hot outside !__eou__i have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice . 
i'm so glad to meet you . __eou__how is everything going on ?
me too . recently , i'm fascinated with net-chat . i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them . i really enjoy it . __eou__don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ?
don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ?__eou__i'm afraid not . every coin has two sides . i think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . 
is it very interesting ?__eou__sure . i get a lot of information and make many friends . 
oh . no . the motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . __eou__wow ! that sounds like pure luxury . 
hey , how would you like to taste my fist ?__eou__alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?
he is sly . he is actually angling for compliments . but he may have got the crush on you . __eou__nonsense ! there 's no indication that he 's in love with me . 
just for fun , not for showing . what do you worry about ?__eou__nothing . i have told you before that i won't go to the party and that 's flat . 
she 's my little niece . it ' s her birthday . they ' re singing " happy birthday " . __eou__oh , i see . how old is she ?
hello mei , how about going for a meal this evening ?__eou__good idea ! i finish work at five . why don ’ t we meet at six ?
let ’ s meet in front of the train station . __eou__ok great , i ’ ll see you at six . 
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends . __eou__now that i look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . i shouldn't have lost my temper . 
by the way , what 's your last name ? i forgot what it is . __eou__it 's lin . it 's spelled l-i-n . 
r-i-n ?__eou__my pronunciation is not very good . it 's l-i-n , lin . 
really ? when did that happen ?__eou__a week ago ? they met last summer and now just sink . they will be married soon . 
mary , pam and i are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes . do you want to come ?__eou__can you say it again slowly ?
mary , why don't you come to my house this saturday ?__eou__i don't know . i 'll have to ask my host mom . 
hi wei , what are you going to do this weekend ?__eou__i think i ’ ll stay in on saturday and rest . 
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ?__eou__no idea . we 've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . what else is there to see ?
i believe most of them think it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__oh , isee . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
great . i hung out with jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . __eou__sounds a good weekend . you know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and jo can become such close friends . 
well , that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty . __eou__i agree . you can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
what time are you leaving ?__eou__1:30 p . m . but i 've got to check in at 12:30 p . m . 
because he is often in trouble . __eou__she has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . 
no , it 's so much worse . and tonight they invited me out to dinner . i really have no idea how i'm going to pull it off . __eou__rough . maybe you can do the most of the talking . 
do you feel better ?__eou__much better . my heart sank when mary told me that she wanted to leave me . 
you are right . they sweep nancy off her feet . and now she fell head over heels in love with him . __eou__how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles !
yes that might be a better idea . __eou__maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . 
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good . __eou__no , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . 
well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__it 's hard to believe that we 're really leaving . the past two weeks was like a dream . 
yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ?
my pleasure . what a pity you have to leave so soon !__eou__we would stay longer . but i 've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . thank you for your warm hospitality . 
he has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . __eou__poor guy ! it will take him a long time to get back on his feet . 
you carried it too far . you obviously offended someone . __eou__i didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . 
yes , i should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . __eou__wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . 
yes , i ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . __eou__well have a good time . get me some autographs if you can . 
i haven't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must . __eou__i agree . they 're very lovely , especially huanhuan
i agree . they 're very lovely , especially huanhuan__eou__is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ?
well , brad from school asked me out just today . __eou__brad bush ? good for you !
i think i'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__oh , i don't think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?__eou__well , there are certain factors that effect people 's size and weight . 
why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ?__eou__that sounds good but i don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
that sounds good but i don ’ t know what ’ s on . __eou__i think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring hugh grant . let ’ s go and see that . 
you can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . __eou__i cannot have the heart to do that . 
every country should face the history . __eou__yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . we have traditional values and long but different history . 
yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . we have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . 
well i wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . __eou__oh i see . so what did you do then ?
he ’ s fine . he retired last week . it ’ s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__he can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
almost two years ? your english is very good . __eou__thank you . but there 's still a lot for me to learn . 
i don't think we 've met . __eou__no , i don't think we have . 
oh yes , i ’ ve been to britain many times . i go there on business . __eou__really ? how often do you go there ?
what a good day !__eou__yes . it 's really wonderful here the grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . 
what about tomorrow ? are you doing anything tomorrow ?__eou__no , i haven ’ t got any plans . 
it 's probably jet lag . __eou__i think so . one minute i feel quite awake , and the next i feel very tired . 
do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?__eou__oh yes , i'm very interested in chinese history so i ’ d like to visit the summer palace . 
yeah , most of the people are from our office . __eou__sounds like i'm missing out on a good time . oh , well , there is always next year . 
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?__eou__yes . you always have a good nose for wines . 
wow ! is it a good car ?__eou__it ’ s a great car . it ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . 
was it expensive ?__eou__put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . 
yes , of course . i can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . __eou__me too , but i think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it 's not very healthy . 
but i also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction__eou__i don't think so . coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . 
you may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . __eou__maybe i could have a try . 
well , i don't know . __eou__let me tell you the story . in 1892 , patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called ' good morning to you ' . but later someone added the words ' happy birthday ' to their tune . 
no , once i fill the tub with beer , i 'll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better . __eou__i think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . it 's appetizing and tasty . 
i like classical music . do you ?__eou__not very much . classical music sends me to sleep
i don't believe you . __eou__it ’ s true . 
how are you tonight , sir ?__eou__oh , not too bad . i'm just glad the weekend 's finally here . 
oh ! good evening . i'm sorry , but she is not in . she 's gone out to the theatre__eou__oh ! i 've just come back from canada and i 've brought a parcel from her parents
i was preparing my supper but i 've finished now . __eou__i can leave the parcel with you , can't i ?
absolutely . through all kinds of stamps i am able to learn about the world . __eou__well , every stamp has a story to tell . 
what happened ?__eou__she was hit by a car . luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt . 
not yet . and i ’ m really hungry now . __eou__i ’ m starving , too . there is a new chinese restaurant close by . do you want to go there for lunch ?
yes , it is . but i ’ ve got a lot of work too . __eou__well , that ’ s life , isn ’ t it ?
oh , cheer up . he ’ ll understand you . __eou__i hope so . 
you look pale recently . __eou__yeah . i have got much pressure in the company . i have tobe wrapped upon my work . 
hello ?__eou__hi , randy . what are you going to do this weekend ?
it ’ s none of my business . __eou__you mean that is my business .

no , i haven't had a chance to . but i have been watching a chinese tv scries called " chinese-style divorce " . __eou__oh . really ? i saw it two years ago . it 's worth seeing and it 's thought-provoking . 
you said it . you know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . __eou__well , it 's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too .

you know the phrase , the survival the fittest . we have no choices . __eou__that 's right , i have to work hard . 
i hear that mary got mad . __eou__so i heard . 
it is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . __eou__it ’ s a typical of them to do so . 
i know that . i met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . __eou__she suffers from cancer .

you mean finally henry bought the broken car himself . __eou__exactly . herry is almost broken now . 
i ’ m not sure now . in any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . __eou__ok , murder will out !

susan has got married . __eou__really ? how do you know that ?
why ?__eou__the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them . 
no . i don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . the man in the other car made a big mistake . __eou__you mean tony is the victim ? no , i don ’ t think so . he ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
mary has really gotten under my skin . __eou__i know what love it . when i was young , i felt the same way . 
but it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . __eou__you are right . 
me too . no one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . __eou__but he has suffered a lot . 
mr . brown is in hospital again . __eou__is he ? he ’ s never been healthy . 
when i went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale . __eou__i ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . 
the last thing i want to see is to lose face before my friends . __eou__that ’ s really unbearable . 
i can look anybody in the face because i ’ ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . __eou__there are not so many people like you . 
that ’ s too bad . how are things now ?__eou__his life is hanging by a thread , and he is under an emergency treatment . 
sorry , i just worried about him . you know , he should be here an hour ago . __eou__don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and i think he can take himself very well .

john has some trouble in his life . __eou__i hear that his father died .

i will never forget linda . after all , she was my first lover . __eou__i think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . 
what do you mean ?__eou__they can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that ' s because they rely on gadgets . 
sorry , here . __eou__thanks . lovely day . pity i ’ m on duty .

i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
you 're joking !__eou__no joke ! that 's why she hasn't married yet . 
what 's the problem ? you don't look happy . __eou__i failed my oral test . 
i failed my oral test . __eou__how come ?
i'm not practicing enough . __eou__why don't you go to the english corner to talk to your classmates in english quite often ?
how about this weekend ?__eou__yes , i think so . 
that 's a good idea . what time is good for you ?__eou__how about saturday morning ?
how about saturday morning ?__eou__sounds good .

no trouble at all . he 's very cute and brave . by the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . __eou__i will . it 's most thoughtful of you . 
i think your speech was excellent . __eou__was it ?
i see . where are you now , li ?__eou__thirty meters ahead is the waterloo bridge . 
why , tom ? it 's five to six already and you are still writing here . __eou__so what ? are we going anywhere ?
everyone in our class enjoyed it too . it ' s very interesting . __eou__oh , i'm glad . 
come on , let ’ s try it . __eou__all right . if you really want to . 
were you in or out ? can you remember that ?__eou__i'm not quite positive . i think i went out at about half pass nine . 
so , tell me , karl , why did you come all the way to minnesota to live ?__eou__we wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in chicago !
baltimore defeated texas by 17 points !__eou__um . . . and what sport are we talking about here ?
i 've been really stressed . it 's the end of the year and i 've got so much stuff to do ! i feel like i'm drowning in work . __eou__well , stress is a real thing . it 's not an imaginary condition . 
really ! you don't have some kind of chinese ghost festival ?__eou__oh . . . sure . we have an entire month ! in traditional chinese culture , ghost month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . 
yes ! how did you guess that ?__eou__it makes sense , right ? who else is going to eat it ?
i ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . you know , i have a lot of stuff . __eou__you can call a mover . 
but think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__that ’ s right . 
wonderful . __eou__it ’ s 8357688 8 . 
hey , look at the offer i got in my e-mail . it says that i can get rich quickly while working at home !__eou__do you also believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy ?
what happens then ?__eou__nothing . the people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . they end up losing . that 's why it 's a scam . 
not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__right , congratulations . 
what do you mean by that ?__eou__i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes . 
yup , that 's him . he made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__i think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he 's still a millionaire . 
we should come here more often . __eou__you are absolutely right . 
oh , so he ’ s half chinese and half american . that ’ s unusual . what languages does he speak , then ?__eou__right now he speaks mostly chinese , and he can say a few english words . but he will learn . 
i don't know . maybe they are really crazy . __eou__maybe . 
i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years . __eou__well , it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul . 
we scored six goals . __eou__i don't believe it . 
i can tell form the way he spoke to us . __eou__never believe his words . 
i'm exhausted . my new exercise is so hard . __eou__i think it is easy . i could work in your class with no problem . 
well , i want to earn more . __eou__i see . 
nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ?__eou__oh , it ’ s lovely . think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
but yesterday you said you would rent it . __eou__i ’ ve changed my mind . 
how old is she ?__eou__she ’ s 18 . 
and a white sports car . __eou__um , that ’ s good . 
how old is he ?__eou__he is in his late thirties . 
no , she ’ s average . __eou__what color are her eyes ?
why ? what had you expected ?__eou__i ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . 
she likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . __eou__sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes . 
how well can you speak them ?__eou__i can speak german quite well , but i can't speak french very well . 
it 's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . __eou__and ? what does it say ? isn't there a name ?
not cash . but if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . __eou__and in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ?
hey , zina . you 're here early today . __eou__yeah , i'm going to be making phone calls all day . what a blast . 
i just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . i appreciate it . __eou__save it , vince . after i put my first million in the bank , i 'll say you 're welcome . 
you guys are working around the clock , i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves . __eou__vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . 
we'd better get back to work . __eou__yeah , i'm not too worried about vince , but i'd hate to face zina if we don't deliver . . . 
no way . i want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . plus , what if it 's vince ?__eou__i don't think so . your admirer seems kind of sweet . aren't you even a little curious about him ?
my boyfriend says i work too much . that i spend more time with you than with him . __eou__was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?
exactly . __eou__will you be going back to australia soon ?
i like brisbane . i had my teenage years in brisbane , growing up in brisbane , um or maybe sidney because it is a big city , but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__oh , nice . actually , what is the capital city of australia ?
tea ceremony ! tell me about tea ceremony . __eou__tea ceremony ! it 's , there 's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there 's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . 
pretty well , thanks . still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night i got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__great ! so , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . many times . when i was younger , you used to get double-decker all over england but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__oh , really . mm ! how much is the fare ?
actually , i'm already working for webtracker . vince never wanted to give me what i was worth , so i figured , what the heck . __eou__no kidding ! i can't believe this . you devil !
didn't joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ?__eou__he has no sense . 
who will sing in the show ?__eou__a lot of stars , including andy , justin , mendy . . . 
eating is important . you are what you eat . it 's not only a daily routine . __eou__well , will you just go back to work after lunch ?
me , either . but , it 's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__that 's for sure . it 's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . 
sandra is actually blue chipper . i don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__that 's fate . 
oh , that 's good news for us . __eou__so what do you provide ?
how can you get that done ?__eou__well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs . 
how is aunty shirley ?__eou__couldn't be better . 
couldn't be better . __eou__how has may been ?
hey , daniel , what 's your favorite weather ? snowy or sunny ?__eou__me ? er , i like hot weather , just like today .

i like blue . you see , that 's the color of the sky . i wanna be a superman . __eou__why ?
okay then . you are the younger customer here ever . __eou__it 's not so wise that you do not explore the children 's market . 
oh , i 've got an idea . why don't you ask dad to go with you ? he badly needs some exercise . __eou__your father is a bit too timid . he even doesn't know how to introduce himself . 
your father is a bit too timid . he even doesn't know how to introduce himself . __eou__he can just say , i'm benjamin . i'm new and shy . 
just in beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . __eou__that 's amazing . 
come on , you are making too big deal out of this . __eou__i just want to remind you to behave yourself . 
i just want to remind you to behave yourself . __eou__ok , dear sister , i see . this kind of thing will not happen again . 
of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you . __eou__don't call me kid . i am a grownup . 
anyway , let 's just finish out job and get back home . __eou__okay . how tiring the job is !
oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . i like it but i couldn't do it that well . __eou__honey , just do it next time . have you heard of the real art in the subway station in russia ?
goofed off ? maybe , but i'm not a clock-watcher . i finished doing what i should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__you 'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . he may probably give you the bag . 
you 'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . he may probably give you the bag . __eou__i'm sure of what i'm doing . 
he said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . __eou__if he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , i don't think a new job can make any difference . 
we are going to the concert this evening . will you join us . __eou__i'm very sorry i can't . 
i thought you had trouble with clive !__eou__no . but now he will be in bigger trouble ! what 's a boyfriend for ? forget about valentine 's day ?
no . but now he will be in bigger trouble ! what 's a boyfriend for ? forget about valentine 's day ?__eou__poor guy ! it 's not fair . you forgot it too . 
wow ! good timing . __eou__excuse me for a while . clive asked me out to a movie ! do you want to join us ?
q-duck ? do you mean the famous roast-duck store ?__eou__yes , definitely . 
this street used to have few stores . but now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . __eou__yeah , they are my wife 's heaven , but not mine . i always get lost in the supermarket . 
it 's clive of course . where did you come from ? every girl knows clive !__eou__really ? he is my type . 
he is everybody 's type . __eou__what position does he play ?
you are so not here ! his girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__oh , my chance is slim then . 
wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__so no more regret now ?
gee ! you scared me !__eou__aha , fitness consultant . very good , don't you know about the rules in this office ?
well , don't do this again next time . what is it about , anyway ?__eou__it is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me . 
aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating . . . __eou__interesting . what were you reading just now ?
you just need more exercise . __eou__yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing !
oh , my god , are you ok ?__eou__of course not !
i told you to wear running shoes . but you don't listen . __eou__i thought leather shoes will do just as well . 
i will get some ice , and put it on your ankle . how does that feel ?__eou__god ! it 's freezing !
irish coffee is my favorite . but i can drink any other . i'm not particular on it . __eou__all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
that ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . __eou__that ’ s for sure . during the back court , we should change the position we played . 
right , i 'll make up my mind . please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . __eou__yes , well done . that 's the way to go . how clever you are ! you 've got it . 
it 's amazing . and when did he begin to play in the nba ?__eou__in 2002 . and since then he has attracted more attention than ever . 
not yet , you know i have a lot of homework to do . __eou__you should speed up , because the story of robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . 
since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . __eou__i will . actually , i am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . 
oh , don't worry about that here . there are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . you know , they are all very strong . __eou__really ? that 's good . is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ?
look ! someone is celebrating his birthday . __eou__this must be his 21st birthday . no doubt about it . 
what about in china ? what'd you do to celebrate your birthday ?__eou__nowadays , it 's no difference from america . but in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it .

i grew up cooking . my mother shared her recipes with me . __eou__i especially like the wonderful chicken dish .

my vegetables are very soggy . __eou__mine are the same way . it seems like they 've been overcooked . 
yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . __eou__i think i got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal .

good luck finding the waitress !__eou__the service this evening has kind of sucked . is that our server over there ?
how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?__eou__i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . 
yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . __eou__are your vegetables a little mushy ?
thank you . i just got these shoes today . __eou__really ? what kind of shoes are they ?
i believe that 10 % is just about right amount . __eou__i think that a tip of $ 3 . 60 will be the right amount to leave . 
no , i haven't . __eou__she 's really pretty . 
she 's not too tall . __eou__well , how tall is she ?
you do ? i just bought this outfit a couple days ago . __eou__seriously , it looks really nice on you . where did you buy it from ?

i think that you look very cute today . __eou__is that right ? this is a brand new outfit . 
she 's probably about five feet . __eou__that 's nice , but tell me what she looks like .

i really don't want to go by myself . __eou__well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ?
you should have , but have you seen any movies lately ?__eou__that was an odd change of subject . 
what 's stopping you then ?__eou__i don't want to go alone . 
no , but that was a random change of subject . __eou__it may have been random , but have you ?
so then , why don't you just go ?__eou__i don't want to see a movie by myself . 
great . that will give me time to talk with my staff before i make final decision . __eou__that ’ s what i was thinking . i ’ ll have them there by thursday . 
have you met the new manager in customer service ?__eou__no , i haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . how is he ?
i guess that must be what i ’ m hearing , i really couldn ’ t place it . do go back to madrid often ?__eou__no , i haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . 
the waitress is bringing the bill right now . __eou__this waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
let 's take a look at our bill . the total price for our dinner is $ 36 . 00 . __eou__how much money should we leave for a tip ?
no thanks . we just need our check . have you seen the waitress ?__eou__oh , here comes our waitress with our check . 
usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . i am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . __eou__i agree that 20 % would be just about right . 
i agree that 20 % would be just about right . __eou__ok , so that will bring her tip to $ 7 . 20 . add it to the $ 36 . 00 and the total is $ 43 . 20 . 
yes , what a nice dinner that was !__eou__we 'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .

i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching . __eou__anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask .

can i get some medicine to help me ?__eou__for your high blood pressure , we have several choices of medications . 
what are the side effects from taking that drug ,__eou__you need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . 
what information does that give him ?__eou__if your white blood cell count is off , it could signal an infection somewhere in your body . 
have you been having any problems lately ?__eou__no , but the nurse at school says that i should have my blood pressure checked .

later this month . i can't wait !__eou__i really envy you . you know i'm not taking my vacation until december . 
oh , really ? is it a good way ?__eou__yes , very gorgeous . sometimes , i can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . 
yes , very gorgeous . sometimes , i can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . __eou__what advantages does it have ?

sure , we do . __eou__how long does it usually take you to make delivery ?
let 's look at that another way . the major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . __eou__what are you thinking about ?
but our order this time is very large . to open an l / c for such a large amount at a bank is costly . can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ?__eou__i'm afraid not . we insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up .

so far , so good . __eou__how come you are walking away ?
are you feeling ok ?__eou__my stomach is bothering me . 
i had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . __eou__maybe the food had something wrong with it . 
have you been under a lot of pressure lately ?__eou__i haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual . 
everything you are doing is perfect . __eou__are you going to leave ?
maybe you have food poisoning . __eou__yes , that could have been it , but i haven ’ t been feeling that great for the past few days . 
maybe you have a touch of the flu . __eou__i think that i might be getting the flu . 
i'd like a facial . __eou__which kind would you like ? we have five different varieties of facials . 
is it urgent ?__eou__yes , it is . it 's very urgent . i feel awful . i have a terrible toothache . 
i must see the dentist now , nurse . __eou__the dentist is very busy at the moment . can you come at 2 pm ?

our price is worked out according to the costing . a 20 % commission means an increase in our price . so , i'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__oh , that 's pitiful . 
all these say a lot for their characters . __eou__so , i want to recommend them for a raise . fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and david to be director of office .

the price of cpu is 260 dollars above 1,000 units . __eou__can you reduce more ?
can you reduce more ?__eou__i'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . 
nice to meet you , sir . i come from new times clothes company . we learnt that your exhibits on the trade fair in shanghai this month were marvelous . would you please quote the price ?__eou__before we discuss the price , may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
in that case , our offer for the white-collar series is us $ 200 , and the other is us $ 300 per set . __eou__do you quote cif or fob ?
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . __eou__impossible . how about 5 % off ?
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l \ c , payable against shipping documents . __eou__i see . payment by lc is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept da or dp ?
why are you quitting ?__eou__i 've had enough . 
let me see the notice . it is here . our booth number is e108 . good number . __eou__lucky number . find its location now .

that 's right . and in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__i know that . i need to discuss this with arden . and in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and internet should be adopted in this campaign . 
could you put it in detail ?__eou__well . we plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com . cn and shanghai morning newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . 
well . arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . and i can talk about tv with him later , because tv promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__i also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our l-series products . meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company 's image . 
i told him that i hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . i also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . __eou__did he want to know the reasons ?
yes . i told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . but i thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . __eou__that ’ s sex discrimination . when will you get the reply ?
do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?__eou__yes , in most circumstances . 
oh , yes . that 's fine with me . maybe we can have lunch together . __eou__great . i 'll see you on the 7th . 
i'm afraid not . why don't you call the help desk ? someone there will be able to help you . __eou__have you got the number ? i 'll call them right now .

2,000 rib per month . __eou__what starting salary would you expect here ?
got it . __eou__you can always call me if you need anything and i will get it for you . 
do you have the meeting report ready ?__eou__certainly . 
no , i thought it was too dull . i'm capable of more responsibilities , so i decided to change my job . __eou__why do you choose our company ?
why do you choose our company ?__eou__yesterday i saw your company 's advertisement . your company is an important international company . working for it , i believe it can improve my abilities .

we have over sixty employees . we have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . we started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . __eou__what 's your annual turnover ?
just over a year i think . why , what 's the problem ?__eou__i'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . is it still under guarantee ?
good morning , mr . chu . would you like me to brief your schedule for today ?__eou__yes .

i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__that ’ s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . 
hello , pratt . how was your interview yesterday ?__eou__hello , finn . i did a wonderful job and i was employed . how about you ?

yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . it ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . __eou__that sounds good . but what do you want me to do there ?
well , first we ask for volunteers . if someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . if no one volunteers we just have to select someone . __eou__ok . i ’ ll volunteer . i could use a free ticket !
mr . lee , all ready to check out ? we ’ ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . how will you be paying ?__eou__i ’ d like to use my master card , if i could . hey , wait a minute ! this is a bit more than i expected . why is it so high ?
what ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ?__eou__that ’ s the mini-bar . each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . the items you consume are put on your bill . 
is that all ?__eou__that 's all , thank you . 
yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . __eou__is your address still 1150 lake road ?
thank you . i am terribly sorry about this . it very rarely happens . we do have a sophisticated tracking system , so i know we will find it soon . but we apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__that ’ s ok . there wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . the shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . 
ok mr . lee . i have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in new york on the 6th at 6__eou__will there be any layovers ?
no , all flights are direct . __eou__perfect ! i ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ?
when she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . i thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__you 're right . if she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ?
on top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people 's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__that 's true . i guess we 'll have to keep looking for a manager then . 
that 's true . i guess we 'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__don't worry , we 'll find someone eventually !
can ’ t complain . and you ?__eou__business is booming . i understand you want to meet up with me next week . how ’ s your schedule looking ?
do you mind if i smoke here ?__eou__yes , i do . i ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . the ac ( air-conditioning ) is also on . 
though the ac has the air-purifying function . i ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . are you okay with that ?__eou__oh , no problem . 
yes , but i have a few questions for you . __eou__ok . ask away . 
first , i ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . however , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . 
yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . however , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__even if i ’ m only sick for one day ?
that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__well , we ’ ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . 
do you have any other questions ?__eou__yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ?
we do actually . we can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?__eou__men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . 
i guess so . i don ’ t have any other questions . should i sign here then ?__eou__yes , please . 
do you have a minute ?__eou__sure , what would you like to discuss ?
sure , what would you like to discuss ?__eou__i 've made a tough decision , sir . here 's my resignation . 
well , i have to tell you that i'm quite surprised . is there any possible way to change your mind ?__eou__i'm afraid not , sir . i 've made up my mind . it 's something i have to do . 
but surely they won't fire you ! you 're one of the most experienced managers here !__eou__well , to be honest , there 's another reason . i 've got a better offer . 
well that 's great news ! congratulations ! where will you be located ?__eou__the head office is in new york , but i 'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . 
yes , come on in . how 's your new job going ?__eou__it 's challenging , but i'm enjoying it quite a bit . 
thanks a lot . __eou__how 's your assistant manager getting on ?
i ’ ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from goldman sachs . __eou__how ’ s it going ?
our headoffice is here in beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . __eou__where will those be located ?
they are all pretty easy-going . it 's a very friendly place to work . __eou__do you miss your old co-workers ?
really ? what is it ?__eou__it 's a job at a recruitment agency . 
nothing special . how about you ? are you used to the life here in the states ?__eou__everything has been fine for the past several months . 
absolutely . that 's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__for example , in china , it 's okay to talk while eating . however , you may regard it as rude . 
good . how about your cover letter ?__eou__a cover letter ? i 've never thought about that . won't a cv do for my job application ?
well , that 's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__i 've considered that . i 'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . 
this way , you 'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__that 's right . i am not the only one who has done this . job hopping is quite common in the it industry . 
yes , i can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . i asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__yeah , feels like yesterday . now i ’ m almost settled down here . we ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . 
well feel free to ask me anything , and i ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__could i first ask about the remuneration package ?
yes , i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__i see , so why did you decide to leave finally ?
i ’ m sure . okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ?__eou__yes , okay . 
certainly . and after your internship ?__eou__they seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really
hi . could you give me a hand with this report ?__eou__sure . i ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . 
i ’ m surprised to hear that . i thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__so did i . i ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . 
may i make a suggestion ?__eou__sure . i ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . 
what do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ?__eou__well , there are several things . of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
i can ’ t just now , susan . could we get together this afternoon ? what ’ s it about ?__eou__well , i ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . 
ok , i am ready to think of other things . __eou__you need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . you 'll do great !

yes , where should we go from here ?__eou__focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . i'm sure you 'll do well . 
happy to meet with you . now , do you prefer group projects ?__eou__i like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . 
i think it should be casual . __eou__i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ?
i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ?__eou__i would prefer chinese food for this party . 
do you remember me ? i just had lunch here a half hour ago . __eou__of course i remember you . 
hmm . i 'll go home and check . maybe you 're right . maybe it 's at home . __eou__i'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . 
no ! oh , my god ! someone has broken into the house . __eou__it looks that way . that 's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . 
look around . __eou__the tv 's still here . 
and your stereo too . so what did he steal ? we have to go look upstairs . __eou__but what if someone 's still up there ?
i think they went to mexico , but i'm not sure . it ' s a bad thing to return home to . they ' ll come home from their trip , and they 'll see half their house burned . __eou__yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt . it ' s better to have a fire in your house when you 're not home . don't you think ?
yes . in england , christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?

you mean it is not created by the burglar ?__eou__definitely not , sir .

i am trying to call a client . __eou__to call a number on the outside you now just dial the number . for inside calls , punch in the extension number . has someone given you an extension list ?

welcome to iba consumer credit . what can i assist you with ?__eou__my family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go .

could i just stop you there ? sorry to interrupt , but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want . __eou__that will certainly cut down the processing time . we can move on to the next step . do you have the purchase price ?
i'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ?
i see . so , it 's not for your company , it 's for the prospective partner ?__eou__that 's right . i feel it 's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what i mean . 
we do indeed . such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__that 's good to know . thanks for your help today , i 'll leave you with the details and you can get started . 
i need to do a credit investigation on another company , but i'm worried it 'll be a bit difficult . __eou__how so ?
how so ?__eou__well , it 's an american company , you see . i'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . 
this scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__that does sound good . i'm already an account holder , have been for many years . and i already have your existing card . 
that does sound good . i'm already an account holder , have been for many years . and i already have your existing card . __eou__that should make things perfectly simple , then . actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . 
ok , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__wonderful ! and , you mentioned ' perks ' ? i do hope i 'll be getting some of those . 
i see . yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . would you like to apply for a card with us ?__eou__yes , please . but i suppose i 'll have to open an account with you first , right ?
indeed . is there anything i need to do before i collect it ?__eou__not really . but we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with .

here it is . i usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__yes , it 's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . we will be putting in a new atm in the near future , though . that should help to ease the queues .

yes , please . my son wants to go overseas , to england , to do his master degree . i wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ?__eou__we certainly do . i can give you some details about a loan called personal loan for studying abroad . we offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . 
personal loans , how may i help ?__eou__i'm going to be studying overseas next year and i'd like some info about suitable loans . to be honest , i'm not even sure if i can get a loan .

mr . smith , i have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than i am c__eou__what are you basing this information on ?
