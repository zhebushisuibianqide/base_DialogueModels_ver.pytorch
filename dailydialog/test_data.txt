what does mm / dd / yy mean ?__eou__that means month / day / year . use numbers . 
i'm going to the bank . __eou__what do you need to do ?
operator . may i help you ?__eou__yes . how do i get an outside line , please ?
i'm attending a conference in sydney this week . remember ?__eou__oh , right . what time is it there ?
channel two . a tv series was showing on it . the name of the series is huanzhu gene__eou__how do you feel about it ?

i thought you had an elephant in your house . __eou__you 're funny . 
you might even dream about dinner . __eou__i don't think i'm going to dream about anything . i'm really tired . 
something 's wrong with my computer . __eou__exactly what ?
yeah , i think i 'll get this one-piece . __eou__why don't you get a bikini ?
did you buy the converter ?__eou__no , i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv . 
well , all right . but i'm not very good . __eou__no problem , rod . i won't play too hard . 
excuse me . i will go to wangfujing , where should i get off ?__eou__there are another six stops . 
we are arriving at tiananmen . please get ready for your arrival . __eou__is it wangfujing ?
ok . __eou__please get ready . 
and would you like anything to drink ?__eou__yes , i'd like a large soda , please . 
oh , no , you don't . __eou__what do you mean ?
well , i think there 's one across from the shopping center . __eou__thank you . 
is it all right to smoke on the bus ?__eou__sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . and alcohol is not allowed . 
bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines . . . darling , it looks elegant on you ! it can't be any cheap stuff . something around two hundred , i guess . __eou__your offer is way off the mark . it set me back only sixty-five . 
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . __eou__oh , really ? i go to the gym every day . 
no thanks , i'm not thirsty . __eou__dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?
the last thing to be ignored at a chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west . 
i need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . __eou__we have some fresh red roses . 
can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?__eou__terry and his number is 4562325 8 . 
so you have all the news on broadcast ?__eou__yes , it 's so helpful . 
i can't find proper parking space . __eou__let 's just park here . 
positive . i ’ ll put the radio on . __eou__( and here is the seven o ’ clock news ) it ’ s only seven o ’ clock . your watch is fast . 
how long do i have to wait ?__eou__two hours . that area is a little backward . 
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__well , i didn't realize that . 
how long will it take me to get there ?__eou__only about twenty minutes . 
may i take a bus to get there ?__eou__you can take the no . 22 trolley bus to get there . 
yeah . i go shopping once a week__eou__why don't you do your shopping at home ?
oh , the bus is gone . __eou__pity we didn't catch it . 
it sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . __eou__what about the one on the yellow river road ?
the plumbing seems ok , too . __eou__the toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water
an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?__eou__oh , that 's a good idea . perhaps i should have a try . 
would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ?__eou__i guess i'm a bit old-fashioned . i'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . 
that 's very respectable , but i could never live with my parents . i usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that 's enough !__eou__how about your other siblings ? do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__perhaps one month . i 'll just have a try at first . 
i 've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?__eou__yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health . 
but it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . there 's no such program on this year . __eou__yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . 
the same is true for ' my hero ' . winners of the contest used to star in the tv series ' the frog prince ' . __eou__i think producers are underestimating the audience . they should think of better ways to entertain the general public . 
there is so much information and i advise to read newspaper . __eou__will that work ?
yes . what is the rent ?__eou__$ 300 per month . 
yes . right now i have a studio . __eou__where is it . 
excuse me , where am i on this map ?__eou__you 're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . 
you 're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . __eou__which bus should i take to railway station ?
which bus should i take to railway station ?__eou__you can take a no . 2 bus here . 
oh , i have a poor memory now . i haven't had enough sleep lately . i had a bad dream just now . __eou__you have been too tired recently , darling . that 's why i didn't wake you up this morning . after breakfast , you can go to sleep again . 
okay . i'm going to stay up a while . i 've got to go over the household budget . we 've sightly overspent this month . __eou__oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? it 's already past 10 . 
oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? it 's already past 10 . __eou__but i'm not sleepy , darling . i want to finish it today . 
it 's nice . so this is the bathroom . and that must be the bedroom . __eou__yes . and there 's a walk-in closet . 
university street . __eou__do you know of any banks near here ?
what about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ?__eou__i thought we 'll just fix up the wood floor . and use some paint for the walls . 
good idea . i was thinking the same myself . __eou__tomorrow we 'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . 
no . it 's only a ten-minute walk . __eou__i see . thanks a lot . 
no , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . __eou__thank you . 
will it take me long to get there ?__eou__no . it 's not far at all . 
that ’ d be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ?__eou__sure , i ’ ll just go put the kettle on . why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and i ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . 
no , it 's only about five minutes ' walk . __eou__thank you very much . 
can you tell me the way to library ?__eou__sure , turn left at the next crossing . 
no , don't worry . i 'll get you off when you get there . __eou__is it a long ride ?
has anything else happened to you ?__eou__nothing else has happened to me , but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 
i agree with you . but now we have to wait . the sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . i fear a thunder storm is brewing . __eou__don ’ t worry . the traffic jam is said to be over soon . 
what a terrible accident ! who should be responsible for this traffic accident ?__eou__i think both . they drove too fast . what 's worse , one of them was drunk . 
could you get there in twenty minutes ?__eou__it will take half an hour to get to the hotel . 
do you have any money ?__eou__for what ?
really ? that ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__well , if you want to live in london , you have to pay the price !
mr . sellers ? it 's steven speaking , your tenant . we 've just suffered a power failure . what should i do now ?__eou__all right , steven . do you have a flashlight ?
you 'll see it 's black and has burnt smell . __eou__then what shall i do ?
turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom . __eou__ok , i see . thank you very much .

okay , i 'll go take a look . thank you so much for your help . __eou__don't mention it . 
yes , i would , thank you . __eou__let me get the manager to sign one for you . 
this one is $ 500 . __eou__wow . that 's too much for me . don't you have anything cheaper ?
the total is 45 yuan . __eou__45 yuan ? it is too much , are you sure ?
it is 45 yuan on the meter . __eou__is there something wrong with your meter ?
oh yes . like this , for example . have you ever eaten jellyfish before ?__eou__no , i haven ’ t . i have never eaten jellyfish before . 
do you want paper or plastic bags for your groceries ?__eou__paper , please . 
sure . you see , tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . people just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__but i think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants . . 
this cover comes with the racket . __eou__how much does it come up to ?
the mark says six hundred yuan , plus tax , it 's six hundred and eighty yuan . __eou__do you accept credit cards ?

i want to have a look at the microwave ovens . __eou__you can have a broad choice here . are you interested in a particular brand ?

barbie ? you know , i might be seven , but i'm not a girl . __eou__do you have a better plan ?
daniel , as a matter of fact , tv is bad for your health . __eou__what makes you think that ?
the traffic is terrible on monday morning . it takes us almost 1 hour to get to school . __eou__my son is the same . but he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the english programmer let 's talk in english on the way . 
that 's wonderful . he is killing two birds with one stone . sir , please turn right at the next corner . and stop at the taxi stand . __eou__ok !

how do you want your hair cut ?__eou__i want it the way peckham wears it . 
oh . i made a mistake . i thought the guy on the right was peckham . __eou__he plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . 
of course . __eou__then yes . 
even though i really like it , it 's just too modern for me . __eou__that 's not true . look over there ! that lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you . 
okay then . and i also want to have my hair colored . __eou__which color do you like ?
where do you need it to be delivered to ?__eou__i want to post it to shanghai .

can i have my check , please . __eou__here it is . 350 yuan all together . 
you can have a free facial and then make up free for you . do you want it now ?__eou__probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i can't afford now . 
good idea . shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ?__eou__maybe we can try shopping on line . 
sure . okay , here is the website . __eou__i'm sure that may would love the pink one . 
probably . people 's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet . __eou__totally . computers bring with them convenience . oh , what 's wrong ?
i know that they already have a range dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . __eou__what about the costumes ?
hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me . __eou__what color do you want ?
it 's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . __eou__bad timing . i want to see them so much . how are they ?

danny , back to your position . move !__eou__ok . bingo ! we win . give me five , mom . 
i said you are sure to like them . there is the grand parade of ants carnival in a few minutes in the square . you will experience a dream of fantasy . __eou__what 's that ?
that 's splendid . can you take three pictures of me with them ?__eou__i thought you had grown out of such child practices . 
me too . daniel , look at your left side . can you see the air force ants ?__eou__wow , that 's my favorite . it 's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 
sounds nice . we will take this , two bowls of shrimp rolls . __eou__ok , shrimp rolls . do you want anything else ?
why not ? it 's my parking space . __eou__i'm afraid not , sir . 
sorry , sir , my mistake . this is your parking space . __eou__that 's all right . it 's not your fault . 
ah . . . i see . __eou__we plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . 
thank goodness !__eou__i 've just had it repainted . 
i am sorry to say this , sir , but you should 've been more careful . __eou__i apologize for that . but the space is too small . 
is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ?__eou__yes ! how do you know that ?
that 's great ! it 's not my day . i just have very bad sense of direction . __eou__is this your first time here ? where are you going ?
yes . yes . can you tell me how to get there ?__eou__wow , it is quite far away from here . i'm afraid you 're gonna have to take bus no . 713 . 
haven't we been these places already ?__eou__yeah . i don't agree with them , but i don't have a better choice . 
look , dad , many people are doing morning exercises here . __eou__yes . i used to come out here with my grandpa as child . 
aren't you happy now ? i hadn't seen the piano when i was a child . __eou__daddy , don't mention it . 
i don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals . __eou__oh , come on , they give them treat too . oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . 
oh , come on , they give them treat too . oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . __eou__cute ? hope so . 
ok . let ’ s go over there . for the lantern festival , you should never omit the yuanxiao . __eou__what ’ s that ? it gets the name from the festival itself . that ’ s really funny !
it doesn't matter . but i really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . __eou__what did you do last weekend ?
actually , i think the paper-cuts is ok , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . they think that is a miracle . __eou__sounds good . i 'll take paper-cut . 
as a matter of fact , i open the shop because i'm interested in the arts . i spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . __eou__wow , you are the expert on it . 
got it . it 's so troublesome to have western food . i 've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . __eou__sure . rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . 
yeah . which restaurant are we going to tonight ?__eou__cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . she said the environment there was really pleasant . 
wow ! they 've got everything here . all the world 's famous brands . aunt cindy , what is your favorite brand ?__eou__i love all the fashionable things . but my favorite brand is chanel . 
come on . fashion is not only for women . men also share the equal right to chase fashion . it 's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__oh , really , that 's really something new . i'm afraid not everyone can accept it . 
that 's true . well , it 's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . so , do you spend all your money on it ?__eou__no . fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . but also , i'm good at financing . i have a credit card , but i never overdraft . 
all right . what kind of red wine do you serve ?__eou__here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . you can have a taste then make your decision then . here is the wine menu . 
how do you want your steaks , rare , medium or well-done ?__eou__medium , please ?
i'm terribly sorry . you know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . please wait a moment . it will be ready soon . __eou__ok , please . 
would you like to have a look ? is it to your satisfaction ?__eou__well , oh my god , there is another problem , i'm afraid . there is still a stain on the shirt . 
i am awfully sorry . please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . __eou__ok , i will . 
don't you know that ? are you kidding me ?__eou__hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . 
ok , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . __eou__oh , so heavy ! what have you put in here ?
sure , then . may it really be a day of enjoyment . other than that , we can also teach him something about science . __eou__science ? what are you talking about ? forget about your science , ok ? it 's a picnic !
here you are . and here are three crash helmets . __eou__thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ?
and the ball went through her window ? that 's not as bad as last time . __eou__true , but that 's not all . the ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window . . . 
i know that i should learn how to save more , but i hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes . __eou__i ’ m sorry . i guess i ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank . 
yes . he 's never said anything so i never told him . but now that he 's getting older . . . __eou__you think it 's better that he should be told ?
oh , it 's interesting . dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . now , it 's my turn . __eou__yeah . we are the vip customers here . so , what do you want to eat today ?
hey , kid , that 's wrong . it 's a chinese restaurant . let 's eat something traditional . __eou__then there is nothing particular i'd like to eat . grandpa , what 's your favorite here ?
i want it to be special . and you know that i always like hot food . __eou__ok then . we shall ask them to put some red chilli on it . 
what ? your golden watch is lost ?__eou__yeah . i just can't find it anywhere . 
that 's true . but i just love it . come here !__eou__oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !
don't underestimate his taste . i don't think he'd like it . __eou__don't be so sure . he loves the vase i bought here last week . 
oh , look , what 's happened to jack ? he sat down . __eou__he may be injured . yes , come on , call the team doctor . 
no , but does that matter ?__eou__yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . 
don't worry about that . he said i can do that at spare time . anyway , it 's just a part-time job . __eou__okay , then . what kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ?
okay , then . what kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ?__eou__it 's a weekly newspaper named olympic english . so i need to be here only on sunday . 
for what ? you have a telephone at home , don't you ?__eou__yes , but i don't want my mom to tap my phone when i call clive . 
it 's my pleasure , what can i do for you ?__eou__i'm from england and i'm trying to make a travel plan for today . 
where are you staying ?__eou__i live in the holiday inn lido hotel . 
but i am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . __eou__they may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . 
dad , it makes no sense . __eou__you may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . 
did you panic at the time ?__eou__a little bit , but i know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least i wouldn't be smothered there . 
yes . they should check the elevator regularly . i have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . __eou__that was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . i think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . 
hi , rita , i'm just looking for a pair of shoes . i won't be here for long . __eou__why not ? when i go shoe shopping , i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices .

what 's for dinner ?__eou__leftovers . 
well ok , i am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__don't worry about it ! making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat !
thanks a lot ! i will definitely do that . is there anything else ?__eou__um . . . yes . here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child 's tumion is overdue . 
well , as you know i was in thailand last month , and i took a cooking class ! so i prepared some of my favorite dishes . __eou__great idea ! as long as i don't get food poisoning ! so what is on the menu tonight ?

what 's wrong ?__eou__i have a headache . these past few days i 've been living off painkillers . man , i feel like my head is going to explode . 
this only signifies that the toxins have left the body . actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . once it 's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__chinese medicine is strange . the patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . 
this is the only way to get at the problem . anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__forget it . i don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . in a little while i 'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . 
well , this home is too big for me now , so i'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . therefore , i need to part with a few things . __eou__oh , i see . umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?

good . by the way , who 's going to cook the meat ?__eou__you 'll cook it of course !

i'm glad we came here . this is really delicious !__eou__i was worried you would think it was too far to drive . 
i think if you try some more authentic chinese food , you might understand how we students from taiwan suffer . __eou__how do you mean " suffer " ?
i mean , in milwaukee there is no good chinese food . so we miss the food in taiwan too much . sometimes we just have to drive down here to chicago to find something better . __eou__even in the winter ?
well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . __eou__thanks . okay . i have my soap . 
it 's no problem . i have time today , and i think it 's important that you find a good place . __eou__it would be hard for just me to do it . i don't know the city at all . 
how about this one ? downtown efficiency . furnished . . . what does furnished mean ?__eou__that means the apartment has furniture in it . 
sometimes it 's good , sometimes it 's bad . you have to like the furniture . __eou__furnished . parking included . $ 400 .

taxi ! ! !__eou__i can ’ t find the business card . do you know the address ?
hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?__eou__oh , sorry . i didn ’ t know .

which child is this ?__eou__that ’ s charles . 
well , i didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 520 a month . __eou__$ 520 a month ? we don ’ t often have apartments as inexpensive as that . we have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on seventh avenue . it ’ s near the station .

well , you already watch too much tv instead of doing your homework , anyway . __eou__there ’ re educational stations too . i could learn while i watched tv . 
how long will it take us to get there ?__eou__i think about ten minutes by bus . 
hello . what time do you close , please ?__eou__we close at 10:00 every day . and we open at 9:00 in the morning . 
same hours as on the weekdays . __eou__wow . you guys never take a break ! i want to come in and have a look at your sale . your sale is still on , isn't it ?
good morning . craftsman company . can i help you ?__eou__uh . . . yeah . hi ! is susie there ?
he just stepped out . can i take a message ?__eou__oh yes , this is penny 's pet boutique . please remind him that his appointment for his dog 's shampoo and cut is on saturday morning at 11 am . 
that 's the wrong direction . canal street is on the other side of chinatown . __eou__oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ?
i cannot get hold of her yet . __eou__see you around , carl . 
don't take that tone with me ! i saw you hit your brother . __eou__no ! he hit me first . 
i have just arrived in scotland and i'm staying at a youth hostel . __eou__eh ?
eh ?__eou__he says he 's just arrived in scotland . he says he 's staying at a youth hostel . you know he 's a member of the y . h . a . 
what 's that ?__eou__it 's a kind of rice ball that is made in malaysia . what about you ?
that sounds great . do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ?__eou__let me think . you could get an indian or thai vegetable curry , or you could get some kimchi . 
is it possible to get a beer ?__eou__why don ’ t you have a water or juice instead , so you don ’ t get dehydrated ?
what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ?__eou__sure . why don ’ t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there . 
there . it looks great , don ’ t you think ? i ’ m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . __eou__i ’ m getting this beret ? doesn ’ t it look cool ? i ’ d like to get some jeans too , but i don ’ t have enough cash on me . 
you are right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__may be we could get some new furniture , better stuff . 
thank you very much , sir . i ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you . __eou__thank you very much . i ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow . 
i don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here . __eou__i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better . 
i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let ’ s go check it out . __eou__the kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space . 
look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . __eou__maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . follow me , please . 
great , thanks . __eou__can i help you ?
how ’ s it going ?__eou__i ’ m fine , thank you . 
if i could , i would like to view the apartment sometime today . __eou__that won ’ t be possible today . 
that 's a good idea . do i need to bring anything myself ?__eou__no . the only thing i need to see is your driver 's license . 
yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?__eou__that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment . 
that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment . __eou__i ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . 
how much is the rent ?__eou__the rent each month is $ 1050 . 
you can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__there are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . 
take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . it will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . __eou__i asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . 
i will be at the apartment today at 6__eou__yes , i can be there at 6 . 
first of all , i need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . do you understand what i was doing there ?__eou__i had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . 
will the utilities be turned on ?__eou__you need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . 
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned . __eou__if i were you , i would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . 
i was thinking that i should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . __eou__that would be perfect . that way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . 
that looks good . the room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . __eou__i ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . 
yes , it would . it ’ s very expensive though . __eou__everything in this magazine seems expensive . you could probably find something similar in a discount store . 
i have redecorated my bedroom . i decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . i also bought a new pair of curtains . what do you think of it ?__eou__i think is looks great . i really like the light colors you have chosen . the pictures are nice too . did you bought any new furniture ?
that ’ s right . they taste so good . we eat them with mint sauce . have you ever tried them ?__eou__yes , i have . i tried them when i visited your country last year . i thought they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
well , i ’ ve bought a lot of meat . i ’ ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties . __eou__i can ’ t wait to start cooking . i ’ ve bought the grill and charcoal . do you have enough plates and utensils ?
these ones here . the one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . __eou__yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons . of water . ok , i ’ m really to do the meat . should i cook it over a low flame ?
right . what are you doing over there ?__eou__i ’ m mixing the sauce . it ’ s my speciality . i make it according to my own secret recipe . 
no dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables . __eou__but i don ’ t like them . it ’ s not fair . 
of course . i made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . __eou__i love your home-made apple pie . it ’ s delicious . can i have another glass of lemonade as well ?
hey , jim . it 's time to wake up and get out of bed . __eou__do i have to get up now ?
you'd better get up , or you 'll be late . __eou__what 're you talking about ? my alarm even hasn't gone off yet . 
i don ’ t think that is too much for rent . __eou__how does $ 850 a month sound to you ?
would you please reconsider ?__eou__that ’ s my final offer . take it or leave it . 
i think i may rent this apartment from you . __eou__that would be wonderful . 
i want to rent this apartment . __eou__i ’ m glad to hear that . 
it 's already half past eleven . you have school tomorrow . you 'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . __eou__i know . but i promise i won't be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard . 
i know . but i promise i won't be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard . __eou__don't you have the exams coming up soon ? i'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . 
i know you 're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed . __eou__no , now it 's bedtime . 
what do you say to $ 850 a month ?__eou__that ’ s no good . 
i want to hear more about this apartment . __eou__all you really need to know is that the apartment looks great . 
let me take a look at that . i can't stop the bleeding . we need to go to the hospital . __eou__i guess cooking is not as easy as i thought . 
oh , really ? where ’ d you find it ?__eou__i was looking through the ads today , and i found it in there . 
i ’ d like to hear about this apartment . __eou__first of all , it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
oh , henry , i haven't seen you for ages . come in . let me take your coat . how are you getting along ?__eou__very well , thank you . 
no more , thank you . __eou__here is to our friendship and health !
really ? i didn't know . let me check . you 're right . __eou__so i couldn't get through . 
i 've heard that people in your country like mutton chops . __eou__that 's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ?
just buy a cask of wine . have you bought ice yet ?__eou__no , once i fill the tub with beer , i ’ ll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better . 
i think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . it ’ s appetizing and tasty . __eou__well , if you say so . personally speaking , i ’ d rather die of thirst than drink champagne . 
it does sound wonderful , maybe i 'll try it . __eou__is there anything else ? maybe i can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot . 
ok , is that all ?__eou__yes . 
good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ?__eou__i'd like cream onion soup please . 
i ’ m a new student . my name ’ s robert . __eou__nice to meet you . my name ’ s sophie . 
nice to meet you . my name ’ s sophie . __eou__are you french ?
don ’ t do that . give it to me . __eou__what are you going to do with it ?
can we talk ?__eou__what about ?
i ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease . __eou__is there a problem ?
what kind of place shall we rent ?__eou__it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . 
does it have automatic transmission ? . __eou__yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning . 
you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . for example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__that 's amazing ! has she bitten you yet ?
pcs often crash from virus , but it 's nearly impossible to get a virus from a mac . __eou__i didn't know that . 
i didn't know that . __eou__has your computer turned back on yet ?
it 's hard to say . while dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of . __eou__have you ever had a dog ?
when i was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home . __eou__they always say that dogs are a man 's best friends . do you think that 's true ?
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters . __eou__how about cats ? have you ever had one for a pet ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned . __eou__you must have been devastated !
do they have to go to school on saturdays ?__eou__no , most children in america only go to school monday through friday . 
i went to a boarding school from nursery school to senior high school . __eou__did you have to wear uniforms ?
but they aren't as light , right ?__eou__that 's right . if you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . 
on all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an am / fm stereo with a cd player . but on the accord , there is another standard item as well . the accord com__eou__cruise control ? i don't like that . 
you have made a good choice , sir . i drive an accord myself . they are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__yes , i know . i think honda is the most reliable car on the road . i would never change to anything else . the honda i have now almost never has service problems . it runs smooth as silk . 
the styles here are too boring for me . i told you . i like street shopping . __eou__oh , come on ! don't be so sour . these are beautiful shirts . i know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . 
yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood . you could call it wood dust . you must wipe it off . the wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . __eou__that makes sense . 
wow ! that 's expensive . __eou__what you 're paying for , ma'am , are the ingredients . it is a very high quality product . 
you could get him a tie . __eou__are you kidding ? that 's the stupidest gift one can buy . i don't want to get a tie . 
i think that 's a great idea . men look great with that kind of bag . where can we buy one ?__eou__i don't think this mall has a leather goods store . so we have to go to state street . 
does he watch a lot of movies ?__eou__yes , he sure does . in fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself . he wants to study film at the university . 
if your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself . __eou__yes , i know that . so i want him to have a good vcr to use . 
why is a dvd better than a vcr ?__eou__for one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better . that ' s because it 's digital . 
thanks . __eou__sorry , becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . 
do you want a cup ?__eou__yes , please . christin . 
i ’ m going to paint it . __eou__what colour are you going to paint it ?
pink !__eou__this bookcase isn ’ t for me . it ’ s for my daughter , susan . pink ’ s her favorite colour . 
no , she bought them in the u . s . __eou__we had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now . 
do you want beef or lamb ?__eou__beef , please . 
because i have just retired . i want to buy a small house in the country . __eou__how much does this house cost ?
and do you usually part your hair along here ?__eou__yes . 
do you sell conditioner here ?__eou__of course . i have one i can suggest . 
great . i would be happy to try it . i know my hair doesn't look good now . it 's too weak . __eou__the problem is the split ends . 
so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?__eou__it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
well , to be honest with you , chinese food is really different from western food . __eou__are you used to the food here ?
well , we have most of the furniture already . we mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that . and albert wants to set up a little off__eou__well , as for albert , he should go to an office supply store . there ' s a very good one called office depot . they have everything he will need . and their prices are good too . it 's very convey

why did it go down so much ?__eou__let 's just say i screwed up more than my econ class . 
hopefully he will use the same exam , cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__if you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .

no , but my little brother likes it very much . __eou__it 's really a good book . you will like it too .

it ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?__eou__sure . it ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! it ’ s great for improving listening comprehension .

these price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . if they 're charging 10 % less than we are , we 've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . __eou__profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . how do they keep their price so low ?

excuse me ! i don't have time to waste . i 've been here almost one full hour !__eou__sorry , madam . you have to wait your turn . the parking lot is full .

what if he had his friends fake the reviews ?__eou__you are so paranoid ! not everybody is a crook , you know . 
i felt as if i had been in a different world . __eou__and i was overwhelmed by this scene , too .

hi , mary ! you 're here already . where 's harry ?__eou__he isn't a punctual person . we may have to wait for a little while . 
that should give us time for a cup of coffee . i 'll go and get some . __eou__make it three cups . here comes harry . 
those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . they do everything together . __eou__birds of a feather flock together . 
what do you mean ?__eou__i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .

i have been working 70 hours this week . i am totally maxed out . __eou__70 hours ? i would be dead if i worked hard like that . 
well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !__eou__that 's not very fair . what did you do ?
have you ever talked to them about it ?__eou__i tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that i didin't want to ever talk to them again !
i can't afford to move right now . __eou__well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . maybe once you get to know them , they 'll turn out to be more sensitive . 
no , he 's from australia . before i met him , i thought australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . i had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . __eou__what are you going to do ?
this is just for you . cheers ! bottoms up . __eou__en . . . it tastes good . i appreciate what you have done for me . 
oh , my god ! my wallet is lost . what should i do ? it drives me bonkers . __eou__dear , don ’ t worry . the police can help you . 
how did the business trip go ?__eou__well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
actually , why don't we go there by bike ? we could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . __eou__that 's true . cycling is good for our environment , too . let me just get my helmet then . 
yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . __eou__but the reservation keeps the car here . that ’ s why you have the reservation . 
alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ?__eou__yeah , you better give me the insurance , because i am gonna beat the hell out of this car .

that should work out great . you are miracle worker ! you have got me awake and motivated . __eou__happy independence day !
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . 
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?__eou__yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . 
how ?__eou__for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense . 
sometimes it goes fast . and sometimes it goes slow . and the alarm doesn'twork , either . __eou__would you like another one ?
i shall . i wasn't as careless as john sampson . he walked across that wet cement over there . __eou__the workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . 
then why isn't there a notice ?__eou__they went to their stores to get one . here they come with it now !
but i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl . __eou__well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners . 
they are just been in friendly , when you are in roman , do as the romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment . __eou__what if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ?
i ’ m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__you see , that ’ s what i ’ m talking about , i can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore
last time when we had dinner at the smith 's , it was a horrible experience . he had no manners at all !__eou__oh , really ?
i know , but i really can't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 
that 's stupid . how can i sleep in this ?__eou__you can wear more clothes . 
yes , and you know what ?__eou__what ?
my brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . i will stay with him and his family in their home . __eou__alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . 
well , since this is your first time , i will do it for you . but next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . __eou__what sign ?
what 's wrong ?__eou__nothing really . 
you should 've been done already . __eou__there you go . 
i really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . __eou__well , let me talk to my manager , okay ?
how about meeting in my office ?__eou__that would work out well . bring any concerns that you might have . 
what do you say to eating out , maggie ?__eou__yeah , why not ? we haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . a new french restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . we can go there . 
no need for that . it 's not usually busy on weekdays . __eou__what time shall we go ?
i enjoyed myself , too . __eou__shall i give you a ride home ?
what kind of magazine is it ?__eou__it 's instructive and inspiring . 
can you do push-ups ?__eou__of course i can . it 's a piece of cake ! believe it or not , i can do 30 push-ups a minute . 
how have you been ?__eou__fine , thanks . how about you ?
mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . __eou__i ’ m glad you like them . happy birthday !
jim , i heard you ’ ve bought a new computer . __eou__yes . look , it is on my desk . 
a piece of cake ?__eou__yes . it ’ s easy and convenient to use a computer . but it takes a long time to really master it . 
have you ever seen coco ?__eou__i 've seen her on tv but not in the flesh . 
i 've seen her on tv but not in the flesh . __eou__i'm so familiar with her songs , but i don't know what kind of person she is in real life . 
i 've heard that you 've made a new strange friend recently , sophie . __eou__yes . he is an old man with a great sense of humour . not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . 
my uncle passed away last night . __eou__my condolences . 
you were right . it 's raining again . __eou__i told you so . 
no , i ’ m on a vacation to see the famous three gorges . __eou__i ’ m going there for a tour , too . is this your first trip to china ?
yes , it is . __eou__why don ’ t we go together ? i can show you around . i think you ’ ll have a better time . 
that sounds like a lot of fun . did you go swimming , too ?__eou__sure . i think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . 
what is it ?__eou__haven't you heard that your novel has won the nobel prize ?
it must have been love at first sight because i know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . __eou__i think you are absolutely right . actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later . 
well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?__eou__it was fun , i tell you . 
did you stop at the fall for some pictures ?__eou__sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . 
like what ?__eou__like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while i'm gone . 
no way . i 'll never find another apartment around here . but i don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__i don't blame you . perhaps you could sublet it . 
yes , but whom to ?__eou__mmm . . . let me think . oh , i know just a person . an old colleague of mine , jim thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from june to august . 
that 's exactly when i 'll be away . it sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__tell you what , i 'll be calling jim late this week anyway , so i 'll mention it to him then . 
i thought you had forgotten . __eou__after the trouble i got into last year , no way . 
i'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__i trust you ’ re keeping well ?
mike 's really angry . __eou__i wonder why . 
time flies !__eou__you 're telling me . 
i must be going . __eou__okay . keep in touch .

what does the paper say ?__eou__nothing much — the same old stuff . a lot of bad news as usual . 
no problem , anytime . __eou__let me know if i can do anything for you . 
could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ?__eou__that would be a possibility . where is this fundraiser taking place ?
maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . __eou__that is a good idea . 
i am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . __eou__are you certain that that is what you want to do ?
yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . __eou__i think you should definitely apply for the position . 
i think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . __eou__what a great idea !
yeah , that would let us know what would work best . __eou__i 'll put the survey online this afternoon . 
i would need to check on that . where is the fundraiser ?__eou__it will be at the beach by the pier . 
don't worry . i'm almost finished . __eou__i need you to hurry up . 
i think there 's more you need to do . __eou__what do you mean by that ?
what don't you like about it ?__eou__i just don't like my hair . 
this is great , isn't it ?__eou__it 's the most fun i 've had in years . 
it sounds great , and is it really cool there ?__eou__yes , i think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the resort . 
does that help you faith ?__eou__yes . 
i promise you that i have the time to do this . if i didn't , i wouldn't offer to help . __eou__what would be the best time for you to help me ?
whoa , look at all those ice cream choices !__eou__yes , that is a lot of choices . what is your favorite ?
have you ever had garlic ice cream ?__eou__that sounds absolutely disgusting !
i could easily give you some time tomorrow night . __eou__would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ?

is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?__eou__no way ! do you have a flavors you don't like ?
i want a different hair style . __eou__what style do you want ?
i want you to cut it to a few inches long . __eou__that 's pretty short . are you sure about this ?
i really want to switch things up . __eou__what were you thinking ?
i think i want to try a new style . __eou__what would you like me to do ?
how short ?__eou__i want my hair to be only a few inches long . 
if you really want me to , then i 'll do it . __eou__i'm absolutely sure that this is what i want .

where 's bob ?__eou__it seems like he 's not coming . 
really , who started the argument ?__eou__he did and it 's his entire fault . 
what are you doing this weekend ?__eou__i don't have any plans . 
of course not . people all over the world watch it on tv , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__sure . it 's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?
so cool . i wish i can go to the live new year 's concert someday in the future . __eou__the right opportunity for you would come along soon . you know , music is transnational . 
actually , more and more people have realized that violence on tv may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__they are especially harmful to teenagers . 
in seven days it will be christmas day . __eou__yes , i know that . 
that will be a tough match , right ?__eou__absolutely . 
no , just come here . __eou__ok , see you later .

i stole many from fred 's farm , and from yours . i planned to have a dog on farm . __eou__so funny . by stealing , i forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . 
i could not agree with you more . for us , there are so many unhappy things and i am so bored ; however , i got lots of fun from stealing . __eou__i really want to be far away from the reality now .

come on in . make yourself at home . __eou__thanks a lot . 
what a coincidence seeing you here . !__eou__it is , isn't it ?
yes , the climate of france rarely has severe winters . in southern france , one can live in comfort the whole year . is japan good for farming ?__eou__yes , japan is good for farming . rice is the main crop , but japan is also an industrial center . fishing is very important , too . rice isn't grown in france , is it ?

i do not like the play with complicated plot . what 's on today ?__eou__' the sound of music ' . this music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . it is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language .

maybe a little of both . the doctor 's can't point out anything specifically . i think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__that makes sense . it 's important to take care of your health early in life . 
it 's snowing outside . __eou__oh , how could it be ?
will it snow today ?__eou__i don't know . do you like snowing ?
well , i won't keep you then . it was very nice of you to come to see me . __eou__it has been a pleasure . goodbye . 
yes , it 's so cold . __eou__do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?
something like listening to music is a good idea . __eou__oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?
oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?__eou__classic . something that could calm your mind .

have you got any hobbies ?__eou__yes . i'm fond of playing the chess and i'm very keen on playing cards . 
you'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . and you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . do you have a cd-rom drive ?__eou__no . 
hop in , i 'll give you a ride . __eou__ok . boy , this looks expensive . 
why do you say so ? can i see your new car ?__eou__of course you can . ( lead carl to his garage . )

i am afraid i can ’ t this afternoon . i take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on wednesday afternoons . __eou__maybe i can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together . 
i think it 's about time that we had to go . __eou__what ? won't you have more drinks ?
you , too . __eou__let 's have pumpkin pie . 
the same to you !__eou__are you going anywhere ?
that new sony camcorder you 've got is just beautiful . __eou__yeah . it is the very latest in digital video cameras . 
like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . __eou__that 's great !
i use short messages quite a lot . if it 's not too complicated i will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__i am informed that many people used short messages to pay a new year call , and only on the spring festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ?
whose handset sounds so beautiful__eou__mine . it 's my heart will go on , the theme song of titanic . isn't it of strong character ?
mine . it 's my heart will go on , the theme song of titanic . isn't it of strong character ?__eou__are you able to compose music ?
you needn't ask anyone . you can get on line to search for one . __eou__can i get on line to search one , too ?

a sony . it 's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . __eou__what about the quality ?

the spring festival is drawing close . by then we will have five days off . i am expecting it . __eou__can you tell me something about the spring festival ?
for instance ?__eou__it has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . it also plays mp3 files , which i can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . 
detached . you 're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . your only link to reality is the earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__there 're a lot of suspicions that the international space station is never going to become reality . is it going to be some future project that never happens ?
well , i'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . it 's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4 . 5 billion years ago . __eou__but maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . 
is there any ticket left for tonight 's concert ?__eou__i am sorry , sir . all the tickets have been sold out .

we parted from each other last month . __eou__have you got a new one ?
i would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . a lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the net ?
hey , frank , there is that janet chick . __eou__wow , what a great burd !
she sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__she 's a real turn-on , alright ?
yeah , a number of times . __eou__what 's he trying to pull anyway .

can you tell me about it ?__eou__you know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not . 
i think john is the best player on the field . __eou__he certainly is . he is the peckham in our collage . 
julia , i saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__i know them . they are the two brothers living next door . 
brothers ? do you know why they quarreled ?__eou__it 's said that the father 's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . 
hi , mrs . henderson . __eou__hi , steven . do you have time and chat with me ?
of course i have plenty of time . what 's new ?__eou__the new couple next door divorced . have you heard about it ?
oh , maybe not . it 's just your guess . do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ok . i close my mouth . 
how much is it for each square meter ? how large is the apartment ?__eou__it 's 7500 yuan per square meter , and i really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . its total area is about 80 square meters . 
not at all . i think the tattoos are so cool and chic . __eou__you can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . 
i'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__okay . please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
hey , look at the tripod . i 've seen it on tv . __eou__it was made 4,000 years ago . it 's priceless !
the results of the poll show bill clinton 's approval rating has gone up in his second term . do you find that interesting ?__eou__well , i think clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . 
in the market . __eou__ok . bottoms up . 
what time are you leaving ?__eou__i 'll leave at 10 o'clock .

oh , really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__i'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it 's lucky that i got you as a partner . 
you went out on a date last night , didn't you ?__eou__yes , i did , but linda stood me up . she didn't keep the date for the first time . 
some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ?__eou__he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ?
too easy questions . listen carefully . hollywood is the movie capital of the world . it is located in southern california . many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__not bad . what kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s
gangster movies . movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__mm . what came after that ?
after all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . then came musicals . __eou__pretty good . please continue . 
that means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__well , he indeed likes me . 
how did you first meet jack each other ?__eou__that is a heavy raining afternoon . i was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . it 's getting dark .

at that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . __eou__what 's her outlook ?
sure . i am free tomorrow . it sounds interesting to me . can we buy the ticket online ?__eou__i don't think so . i think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . 
that 's right . but i don't think there are better ways . __eou__how about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?
are you a smoker ?__eou__yes , i'm afraid i am . my husband is a smoker too . 
i had my first cigarette when i was seventeen . __eou__might i ask if you have tried to give up smoking ?
i never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . __eou__well , now you know . let 's go to the lake over there . some people are fishing over there . i haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , i really want to try . 
i want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__me too . i finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 
she is miao li . she 's come here to see her brother . __eou__oh , it 's so . she looks very lovely . could you give me some else information on her ?
what does she look like ?__eou__well . . . 
true enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . i don't know where you 're wasting your money but i think you need to take a look at what 's really important . __eou__so how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?
i'm not disciplined enough i guess . __eou__in a few months i'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . i think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . 
hey , jeff , where 's your stereo ?__eou__i needed some money , so i hocked it last week . 
what , curly ?__eou__no , not at all . very straight . her hair comes down like this . . . just over the ears .

we don't care about money . we'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties . __eou__ok . 
what time do you open this evening ?__eou__we open at 6:30 , sir . 
special effects ? baloney ! that movie was made on a shoestring budget . they 've been using trick photography like that for years__eou__okay . but you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . 
okay . but you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__you should read the book . the original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . 
oh , really ? how does the book end ?__eou__read it yourself and find out !
with pleasure . __eou__you dance well . do you breakdance ?
well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . __eou__and disco a kind of nightclub . 
and disco a kind of nightclub . __eou__right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music . . . 
so . . . disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it . and breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . __eou__you are witty . 
me ? oh , no . in fact , i took up dancing quite recently . __eou__oh , really ? but you 're doing the waltz wonderfully well .

i'd better be going . __eou__so soon ? why don't you stay a little longer ?
thank you for a wonderful meal . __eou__i'm glad you enjoyed it . 
i might be able to do that . but i don't think i can do it well . __eou__don't worry . it is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . just to finish it is considered a victory for most . 
i'm afraid i 've got to go . i have another appointment at five . __eou__do you ? by the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ?
thank you . come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . i 'll have the pictures ready by then . __eou__i will .

i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
that sounds crazy . but they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . 
hi , long time no see . how have you been ?__eou__oh , i 've been fine , but i'm having some trouble with my son .

well , it 's started raining since then . look out the window ! it 's pouring rain out there !__eou__have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
i usually bowl with an eight ball . i like the control of a light ball . i can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__well . i like them a little heavier . i don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . 
i want to do everything i can . __eou__do you have clubs ?
like the seven-piece set . it 's only $ 120 . __eou__i 'll buy a set . but you have to teach me . 
my native place is shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__so are you a local ?

how often do you go back to visit them ?__eou__once a year . 
it must be fun . but you know , i am not good at chess . i never won since i 've learnt to play chess . __eou__don ’ t worry , i will teach you how to win . 
don ’ t worry , i will teach you how to win . __eou__ok , settled then . 
only once or twice at the most . __eou__do you know why ?
do you know why ?__eou__i have no idea . 
how 's your business ?__eou__everything seems to be getting worse . i don't know what to do with it . 
but he is not someone who can be led by the nose . __eou__but i am not that someone . i can easily talk him into doing whatever i want him to do .

yes , he 's married . __eou__i remember now . i met him before . 
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you !__eou__will , i'm under a lot of pressure . my manager is very pushy . he assigned me two projects . now the deadlines are near but i have finished neither of them . 
i know your feeling . take it easy and say something to me if you like . __eou__oh , buddy , you are so kind . thank you !

not interested ?__eou__not really , to be honest . some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . 
they 're also known as bell-bottoms . they are a type of trousers . __eou__it 's too complicated . i 'll just stick to the plain clothes . 
that 's a good idea . and in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . __eou__you are right . let ’ s stop idling around and do something . 
there were some famous ugly women in history . __eou__yeah ? were they famous because of the ugliness ?
you look tired . did you sleep well last night ?__eou__i stayed up all night writing a report . 
i stayed up all night writing a report . __eou__go easy . overwork is bad for your health . 
jack and stephanie . __eou__how old are they ?
how old are they ?__eou__stephanie is 18 and jack is 24 . 
is she here now ?__eou__no , she 's at school . 
it can't be dry , and can't die . __eou__i don't know whether we are in a dream . 
the aquamedic pool is included . you can choose three . __eou__we 'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . 
really ? thank you . i am thinking the same thing about you . __eou__i prefer the old style of dance because i enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely . 
i quite agree with you . see the woman there ? i dare say she hasn't got any eyes . how could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? and all that jewelry !__eou__the gown is quite expensive , believe me . 
you know those upstarts . they 're all show-offs ! i think i'd better have a diet ; otherwise i'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__you 're quite slim . in fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . 
are you sure she is the right girl ?__eou__sure . she is the ideal girl , the one i had dreamed of . 
indeed . i love the smell of the grass and trees . they certainly refresh my mind . __eou__can we stop here for a while ? my backpack is very heavy . 
let me see . it 's not an eagle . i think it 's a vulture . __eou__yes . will it hurt us ?
yes . will it hurt us ?__eou__i don't think so . let 's walk by the stream . i am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . 
i also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . if you are hungry , you can let me know . __eou__you are kind . look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . 
that 'll be for you to decide . i 've got a new dish that i want to try out on you . __eou__i'm ready . i 'll look forward to it all friday !
down to his shoulders . it 's beautiful , like gold . __eou__ok . ok . you'd better tell me what he does . 
fine . __eou__you 're going to like him . everybody says he 's a nice guy . 
what does the notice say ?__eou__it says ' wet paint ! '
hi melissa , are you going home this weekend ?__eou__no , not this weekend . i have too much work to do . 
how wonderful it is to be in love ! it 's love at first sight ! oh . he 's my romeo !__eou__hey , julie . how 's it going ?
hey , julie . how 's it going ?__eou__oh , mary . you 've surprised me !
i really love you . __eou__no , i shall faint . 
how is your family ?__eou__pretty fine , thanks . 
where are you going now ?__eou__i am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . i must go now . 
if you have any question , you can ask me . __eou__ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . i am leaving . 
yes , he was 29 then . __eou__he looked his age . 
does she have any piercings or tattoos ?__eou__i think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . 
your house is too small . why not buy a big one . __eou__i do wish i could afford one . 
well , i'm not sure . maybe it means we can buy something through the internet . __eou__that 's right
hello , daisy , how are you doing ?__eou__fine , thank you . i haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . what have you been up to recently ?
but it 's really exciting . __eou__maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . 
look at the girls in the street . they all have a bunch of flowers . is it valentine 's day ?__eou__oh , yes ! i completely forgot about it . 
sure , i'm heading out myself . enjoy your evening . __eou__thanks , sir . you too . drive safely , i hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . 
i'm sorry . i'm attending a meeting at the hilton then . __eou__what about the next day ?
oh , china does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . __eou__yeah , we 've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in wenchman . 
yeah , we 've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in wenchman . __eou__we 're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face wenchman earthquake . 
well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__that 's alright . i just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . it almost drives me crazy . 
well , i'm afraid your father 's not interested in modern films . __eou__we could find a classical one . 
can't bear it , right ? i 've been there before . i 'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__yeah , that 's right . if no one sends me text messages , i 'll go crazy . 
yes , it is . do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ?__eou__absolutely . 
sure i am . i 've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__oh , it seems that i'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ?
how 's life going , zhang lin ?__eou__yes , the same as ever , thanks . what about you ?
she 's probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__i 've given her enough time . i'm over it now . 
did roll win the race ?__eou__yeah , he did . but he only won it by a hair 's breadth . 
hello , jack ! fancy meeting you here !__eou__yes , it 's really a surprise . how are you ?
i'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot . __eou__you are a woman after my own heart . i don't know many people who can handle spicy food . are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
no . . . __eou__never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
never mind . there 's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?__eou__that 's it ! that ’ s the one i was thinking of ! i told you i'd remember it !

what about your step-brother ’ s mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?__eou__no , she also died when my step-brother was little . my mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later . 
really ! did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ?__eou__no , but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at a club near my home !
let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . __eou__that happened quickly ! are you going to see him again ?
what about me ? i ’ m your friend . __eou__i know you are , you are my girlfriend . i wish i had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes .

that sounds interesting !__eou__yes , it 's a great job . i love it . and what do you do ?
which restaurant ?__eou__hamburger heaven . 
just so so . i am too tired . my company has been holding too many training sessions lately . __eou__that 's good . not evey company provides employees with training opportunity . it seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . 
i have tickets to the phantom of the opera on friday night . would you like to go ?__eou__thanks . i'd love to . what time is the show ?
why are you asking me the strange question , jerry ?__eou__i watched the movie forrest gump last night . and the question just lined in my mind .

how are you feeling , john ?__eou__oh , not too bad , but i 've got to stay in bed . 
ok , i will . you have said that many times . __eou__are you hungry ? do you want me to buy something for you to eat ?
maybe we all will be all things to all men . __eou__how terrible !
yeah . he 's known as a sly dog . he 's done many people in . __eou__he hits below the belt . 
but in my case , the fact matches the theory . mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . it frightens me !__eou__but as far as i remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . 
what is that below ?__eou__it is the colorado river . you will go down the river in a boat if you wish . 
look , it 's all water over the dam now . let 's leave it behind us . __eou__yeah , i know , but it 's too hard to do . 
really ? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__i hear that john 's leading a double wife . 
it is high time you have a talk with him . that may help clear the mists . __eou__i did , but he gives me a runaround .

joe , how are you doing ?__eou__pretty good . mary , i was wondering if you would like to come to a party on friday night ?
i would really like to bring my friend jake , if that would be ok . __eou__oh yeah , i remember jake . that would be fine .

fine . __eou__you look prettier than before . 
you look prettier than before . __eou__really ? thank you . 
good . see you !__eou__bye !
sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__you were lucky then . what did you do after that ?
we went for a swim in the sea . that was the best part of the day . just look at my nice tan . __eou__so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 
yeah . i do it once a week . __eou__is it very interesting ?
i am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__have you heard of motor coaching ? it 's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . 
it 's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__is it just a bus ?
what about your friend ? did she fall for him ?__eou__of course not ! she thinks he 's an apple-head . she doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . 
well , imagine that ! how old are you ?__eou__eighteen . some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight . do you want to come ?
ok great , i ’ ll see you at six . __eou__ok , see you tonight ! don ’ t be late !
okay . __eou__by the way , what 's your last name ? i forgot what it is . 
my pronunciation is not very good . it 's l-i-n , lin . __eou__i got it . mary lin . 
so i hear . __eou__yesterday i met mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary . 
oops . i meant , " think "__eou__mary , you 're going to have to work on your pronunciation . 
pretty good . i 've made a few friends already . __eou__anybody i know ?
hey lucas , how was your trip to paris ?__eou__it was wonderful , but i was so tired . 
yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you 're abroad . sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__on the fourth day , we went to taste the french cuisine . that was really fantastic . and no stomach problems . 
what do you mean ?__eou__well , i mean . we always do the same thing . there ' s no variety in our lives . 
he sure is !__eou__come on . i 'll introduce you two . 
peter really is a remarkable expert ! there is very little he doesn ’ t know . __eou__i have exactly the same feeling . this afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . he knows a lot about investments . 
exactly . having jo as my friend is one of the best things that 's ever happened to me . __eou__yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . 
what is it ?__eou__the state of economy is starting to go up in our country . 
i 'll see you at the airport at 12:30 p . m . __eou__ok . see you tomorrow . 
i doubt it . last time was an oral train wreck . listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . __eou__oh come on , it 's not that bad . 
you married him for that reason ?__eou__definitely not . the most important thing was we loved each other . 
a plant ? that 's creative . i'm sure ever time she waters it she 'll think of you . but there is a problem . do you think it 'll be able to get through the customs ?__eou__i hope so . i 'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . i hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 
i hope so . i 'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . i hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__i don't know . i think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . you don't want to get her in trouble . 
do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?__eou__i heard it might rain . 
cindy told me about you in our gym class . __eou__i see . do you live in this neighborhood , too ?

then we 've got to get going . __eou__ok . bon voyage and a safe landing .

cheer up ! let bygones be bygones . __eou__i ’ ve tried it , not a chance . 
i ’ ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__it seems you have to take time .

every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . __eou__you were showing respect and admiration for them .

yeah , i guess so . __eou__you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . 
do you think the taxi driver will understand you ?__eou__if he doesn ’ t understand me , i ’ ll show him the office address on my business card . 
my son closed his ear to what i said . i don ’ t know what i should do . __eou__you can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . 
but there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__i believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . 
ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ?__eou__no i didn ’ t . i worked in the morning then i played tennis with my husband .

me too . i feel very thirsty as well . __eou__let ’ s go then . 
where else haven't we been to yet ?__eou__they are the folk antique handicrafts and collectibles exhibition halls . 
the bartender just gave the last call . let 's order another round , okay ?__eou__sure , but let 's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close . 
sure , but let 's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close . __eou__that sounds good . you order the beer while i go to the bathroom . where is the can in this place ?

well , not everyone wants to drink beer . make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . nothing 's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . __eou__i don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , two super bottles of cola should cover everyone . what about wine ?
just buy a cask of wine . have you bought ice yet ?__eou__no , once i fill the tub with beer , i 'll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better . 
i think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . it 's appetizing and tasty . __eou__well , if you say so . personally speaking , i'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne . 
do you want black or white coffee ?__eou__white , please
i ’ m so sorry . __eou__that ’ s ok . don ’ t be sorry . we ’ ll talk later . 
one screwdriver , coming right up . ( he mixes the drink . ) here you are , sir . __eou__thanks .

i got my father ’ s goat last night . __eou__what did you do to get his goat ?

do you like your current job ?__eou__yes , i came to beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . i was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . 
how did jim get the money ?__eou__he borrowed it from nick .

i understand your feeling . when someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . this is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . __eou__that 's right . but feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . we must make a clear cut between them .

it ’ s a typical of them to do so . __eou__what can we do ?
betty was in hospital . __eou__i know that . i met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . 
she has keen to buy something which is much cheaper . __eou__mothers like that .

i am not sure . __eou__don ’ t lose your reason . go to find him and talk with him . 
i have no idea about what to do next . __eou__maybe you can pick mary ’ s brains now . she knows a lot about stocks . 
maybe you can pick mary ’ s brains now . she knows a lot about stocks . __eou__let me have a try . 
in my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . __eou__who do you think that has the motive ?
the problem is that i just have no one to turn to right now . __eou__that ’ s stupid . 
oh , i know . she is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . __eou__i hear the school is very modern . it has the best equipments . 
i hear the school is very modern . it has the best equipments . __eou__yes . do you know its name . 
don ’ t be fool . i ’ ll always side with you . __eou__i appreciate your kindness .

have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ?__eou__you said it . we ’ er breathing poisonous air every day . 
you said it . we ’ er breathing poisonous air every day . __eou__i think it ’ s time for the government to take strong action . and people should try to protect environment . 
by the way , are you going to the concert tomorrow ?__eou__i am just thinking of it . maybe i ’ ll go . 
why should i go against her ? she always seems to have better ideas . __eou__have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ?
the government has to face a lot of social problems now . __eou__i think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . 
there are not so many people like you . __eou__you are flattering me . 
i ’ m going to the hospital . __eou__what ’ s the matter ?
don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and i think he can take himself very well . __eou__but he still does not come back .

my mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . __eou__if you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . you can ’ t have it both ways , of course . 
do you think i should ask bob to help ? will he come ?__eou__no problem . you know him . he ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles . 
no problem . you know him . he ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles . __eou__that ’ s right . but i have bothered him several times . 
why is that ?__eou__the government will never fulfill their promise . 
what did he aim at ?__eou__he began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune .

wow , that looks beautiful . __eou__it 's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . 
they can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that ' s because they rely on gadgets . __eou__that 's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . 
oh , i won't be back so early . the film will be over at nine . can i have the key to the bicycle ?__eou__no . i won't let you ride a bicycle late at night .

where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty pm ?__eou__nine twenty pm , i couldn't say . i cann't remember .

that 's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?__eou__i ’ m planning on living with my parents . won't you ?
oh , right . now i know why they would want to see our boy . it ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! are they expecting a boy or a girl ?__eou__it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three-month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
no , i'm talking about american football . the world cup is soccer . __eou__oh , i understand . i can't say i'm a big fan . i'm from china , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . 
it seems americans are very passionate about sports . is this just a part of your culture ?__eou__oh , yeah ! i think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . americans come from many different backgrounds so i guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . 
i know education is expensive , but it 's been my lifelong dream . call me crazy , but i 've always wanted to have that phd at the end of my name . __eou__well , getting a doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . can you afford that ? can you survive that ?
feed them ?__eou__yeah . . . we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . 
okay , thanks a lot . you did me a great favor just now . __eou__you ’ re welcome . 
but it seems like a good idea . all i have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . after that he 'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__sounds like a pyramid scheme . have you heard of those before ?
sounds like a pyramid scheme . have you heard of those before ?__eou__pyramid scheme ? what is that ?
well , every department is different . you wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you 're a grinch , right ?__eou__what is that ?
oh , please come in . nice to see you . __eou__on , what ’ re you doing ? you look as busy as a bee . 
yeah , i ’ m trying to decorate my house . __eou__really , that ’ s cool . let me see what you ’ ve done . 
and it ’ s a bargaining . a house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__great , is it a two bedroom house ?
yes , but i ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . i haven ’ t put anything away yet . __eou__don ’ t worry . it ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . 
i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes . __eou__yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . 
what are you reading ?__eou__i'm reading about michael milliken , the bond king . 
ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?__eou__well , we have the thompsons , the greens , and the anderson , about twelve people total . 
i think you 're making a mountain out of a molehill . it 's only a superstition . it really doesn't mean anything . __eou__absolutely not ! i refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on friday !
so when did this happen ?__eou__last weekend , while they were on the sik trip . 
what'd he do ?__eou__he kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
i have to see my daughter . __eou__when poyou have to see her ?
i think so too . it 's just pointless . __eou__then why are so many crazy about it
you thing so ?__eou__oh , without doubt . when is the next class ?
but saturday is my birthday . __eou__i think it ’ s important to do now . we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . 
i think it ’ s important to do now . we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . __eou__but it won ’ t be on my birthday . 
i see . __eou__not only that . the job i ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . 
don't worry . he is an acrobat 。__eou__i see . 
i ’ ve got a new boss . __eou__oh , what ’ s he like ?
saturday my parents are coming to town . what ’ s up ?__eou__what about tonight ? do you have plans tonight ?
no , do you want to go and do something ?__eou__yes , yes , i want to take you to dinner . 
what a party ! i hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__these girls are different , they are not wimpy . 
ok . and who are you more like , your mother or your father ?__eou__i think i have traits of both , actually . i look more like my mother . 
i might make nothing even if i stay . for that kind of risk , i want to get rich . __eou__ok . if you sign the stars . com account before webtracker does , we 'll talk next week . 
do you think we 'll make it ?__eou__i guess we 'll either make it , or we won't . 
the only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is zina . __eou__yeah , she is some kind of superwoman , isn't she ?
and where would you get a cup of cappuccino ?__eou__now that would be hard to live without . we city folks are pretty spoiled . 
now that would be hard to live without . we city folks are pretty spoiled . __eou__maybe . but i ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . 
and then she made the deal with micropower . vince wanted to sell for fifteen million . . . __eou__fifteen ? and zina pushed them up to seventy-five ?
anyway , i'm still happy i left . i'm working as a freelancer now . __eou__you really should have stayed with us , dave . 
this is going to surprise you , but i'm happy . i think you 're making the right move . __eou__you do ?
i'm filthy rich ! haven't you heard about the micropower deal ?__eou__yeah , i guess i did . they 're going to buy invoking ?
yeah , i guess i did . they 're going to buy invoking ?__eou__that 's right . for seventy-five million . so how are you ?
me too . she is so young and talented . she is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . __eou__yeah . though she was so popular , i heard she managed to maintain a low profile . 
no , i never did . it 's for my son . he loves it , and i made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__that 's really smart . my son daniel is the same with your son . i just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . 
yes , stones . __eou__well , i can ’ t just imagine it . 
how has may been ?__eou__she 's been good . she is in grade one in joy chain high school . and she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . 
ew , danny , gross !__eou__by the way , what 's your favorite weather ?
i love snowy , because it is very very romantic . __eou__look , is that tom ?
i think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . __eou__and english is very useful in your job . 
you will be a very promising one . __eou__that ’ s my wish . 
no , not at all . go ahead . __eou__are you married ?
i'm from germany . __eou__so you speak german , don't you ?
yeah , but i can speak english , too . __eou__oh , i see . what other languages can you speak ?
not really . but i like it in spring and fall . i don't like it in winter . __eou__why ?
yes , i'd love to . here is a good one , mozart and beethoven . it ' s on the festival hall . __eou__fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
absolutely right . he gave a performance of felix mendelssohn 's violin concerto . that caused a sensation . the audience were stunned by his pure tone . __eou__obviously you did enjoy the concert . 
are there any cities where it rains a lot ?__eou__several . two good examples are seattle , in the state of washington , and portland , oregon . 
tell us about some cold cities . __eou__in the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter . boston and chicago are two of them . 
well , i don't know . __eou__let me tell you the story . in 1892 , patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called " good morning to you " . but later someone added the words " happy birthday " to their tune . 
so the " happy birthday " song has been popular since then ?__eou__yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932 . people all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
oh , i see . __eou__how about you , daniel ?
how about you , daniel ?__eou__i'm a real man , and i like football . 
wow , my son is so clever . __eou__mom , that 's a stupid question . 
it 's not so wise that you do not explore the children 's market . __eou__it 's the marketing 's fault , i suppose . what do you want to do ?
i am still young . and i'm growing every minute . __eou__sure . then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .

this way you 'll probably put on more weight . will you give up ?__eou__surely not . i can feel the results . i'm starting to feel different now . 
then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ?__eou__i'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed .

oh , i love michael jordan . he fills people 's lives with great excitement . __eou__used to . but now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . but kobe is the upcoming superstar now . 
jordan is a legend , anyway . an idol that no one can replace . i think clive can make a good professional basketball player . he is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__you know what , he is also an outstanding football player . he is surely to be a star of tomorrow .

mom , it 's so terrible . water went down into my throat and i almost got drowned . __eou__do be patient , honey . let 's do it slowly and correctly . 
never mind . after all he is not so attractive as yao ming , right ?__eou__you are always so naughty . 
hey , daddy , today i had really a fantastic history class . __eou__wow , it 's so strange for you to say things like that . what had happened ?
of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in ming dynasty . __eou__good , by the way , do you finish reading the book robinson crusoe i 've bought for you ?
i'm sorry . every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . that 's out regulation . __eou__yeah , i see . you are just doing your job . but i wanna know what the advantages it has . 
as far as i know , people will be weak if they swim too long . __eou__that 's right . but the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . 
that 's terrific !__eou__by the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . i hope i can see you there . 
exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . __eou__there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming . 
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?__eou__of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
this must be his 21st birthday . no doubt about it . __eou__why ? do you know that guy ?
wow . that 's wonderful . __eou__what about in china ? what'd you do to celebrate your birthday ?
cool . your guitar skills are very impressive . how did you learn to play like that ?__eou__i picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . afterward , i taught myself by listening to some records of top players . 
this question has really been bothering me . i like chinese literature , you know . but economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . __eou__i will choose what i like . you don't know what a torture it is for me to study english , because i don't like english . 
i will choose what i like . you don't know what a torture it is for me to study english , because i don't like english . __eou__though i like chinese literature very much , i'm also interested in economics . it 's a tough choice to make . 
you can decide later . you will have choices before you submit your university application form . __eou__right . i have lots of time to think carefully before i make my final decision . 
wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . now , i can see why it 's called the lantern festival . it deserves its name . __eou__yeah . people always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances . 
did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?__eou__sure . but you know that i can't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
dad , i want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . __eou__that 's a good idea . you'd better hurry up before they 've filled all classes . many people are learning how to drive now . 
ok . look , i 've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . __eou__let me see . teetee training school , summer program , 3,000 yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver 's license within three months . 
that 's right . __eou__i also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship . 
i also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship . __eou__you sound quite knowledgeable . 
daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ?__eou__is that different from this kind of zoo ?
why not ?__eou__because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . you can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . 
that makes sense . but that sounds interesting . is there one in beijing too ?__eou__yes . 
yes . __eou__i prefer to go there next time . 
i 've heard the hitchhiker would be on next week . i want to see it . __eou__is it horror movie ?
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight . __eou__you were dull at that time . 
life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you 're gonna get . __eou__that 's my favorite . 
you know , it also won 6 oscar awards in 1995 . unbelievable !__eou__it deserves . that film can give us a lot of inspiration . 
wow , it stars catherine zeta-jones , my favorite actress . __eou__well , birds of a feather flock together . i like her too . she was in a lot of dramas . 
nice weather , honey !__eou__the days are getting longer !
really ?__eou__last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
well . . . er . . . it is just . . . just that i . . . __eou__just what ? stop beating around the bush . tell me what you want to know . 
yes ?__eou__then you must be off your head . he is a real bastard . 
i'm exhausted . my new exercise class is so hard ,__eou__i think it is easy . i could work in your class with no problem . 
oh , without a doubt . when is the next class ?__eou__tomorrow morning . try it . 
well , how about the museum of modern art ?__eou__no , i don't like museums . they 're boring . 
no , i don't like museums . they 're boring . __eou__why don't you go to see the empire state building ?
let me introduce myself , by the way . my name 's thomas bradley . __eou__how do you do ? i'm ted nugent . 
glad to meet you . __eou__and what do you do , ted ?
salesman ?__eou__yes , that 's right . and how about you ?
oh , really ? what do you do there exactly ?__eou__i'm in the personnel department . 
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__that ’ s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
i really hate receiving spam . i also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__yes , that annoys me too . with billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . i like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . 
yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !__eou__right . you can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . 
right . you can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . __eou__in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
did you ever win any competitions ?__eou__i was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . i usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but i couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . how about you ?
do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? i want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__yes , i ‘ m just reading them myself . it ’ s been a great competition . we got gold medals in three events . 
the woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__that ’ s amazing ! were any other records broken ?
that ’ s amazing ! were any other records broken ?__eou__a russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . 
i was just watching a documentary on tv about how people use dogs for various purpose . it was very interesting . __eou__i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . 
your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . the flowers are really colorful . __eou__thank you . i have roses , tulips , and daffodils . do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?
when the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__tomorrow , i ’ ll cut the grass . then the garden will look perfect . 
i certainly was ! however , the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !__eou__is there any pain now ?
how do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?__eou__i think that the public transport system could be made simpler . i never know where the bus routes actually go . the routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . 
i think we just need to build more roads . then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__if we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . i think we should discourage people from using their cars . 
the air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . the problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . it well be unpopular . __eou__that ’ s a good point . car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . 
the second driver was luckier . he had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . __eou__yes . he was released from hospital yesterday evening . the other man could be there for weeks . 
i can ’ t keep up with the game . the players play so quickly that i can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__i have the same problem . the players are really very skilful . i wish i could play that well . 
how many more games are there this season ?__eou__we ’ ve got four more games . i hope we can win all of them . 
when you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?__eou__yes , i did . there ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so i ’ m sure i haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
that ’ s great . can you do it anywhere ?__eou__no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them . __eou__it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . 
yes . in england , christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
the article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if english continues to be the dominant language . __eou__right . all the people who speak chinese . hindi , french and spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . 
i know what the characters on the paintings mean . i think chinese characters look very artistic . it ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__i think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
good idea . we should also pedicures and manicures . __eou__this could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !
so , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on friday ?__eou__of course !
he ’ s a year older than keith , but he looks younger . __eou__how ’ s your father ?
i ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . he ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__he ’ s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . 
not so well . i 've come down with the flu . __eou__i'm sorry to hear that . take care of yourself . 
i'm sorry to hear that . take care of yourself . __eou__it 's really great to see you again . how about a drink tonight ?
ok . __eou__i 'll pick you up . 
yeah . how are you these days ?__eou__fine too . 
did someone meet you at the airport here ?__eou__yes , thanks . 
we don ’ t have a national day . __eou__really ? that ’ s unusual . 
the interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . they are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__i noticed that too . what are the people learning ?
well , we could go to a movie . have you see shrek 2 ?__eou__i have , actually . how about the movie , million dollar baby with clint eastwood ?
perfect . are you prepared to give me all your money ?__eou__huh ? we are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ?
i know , but it was a celebration , you kwon ? i don ’ t think i ’ ve see you drunk . __eou__i usually only drink beer and i rarely drink more than a few pints . 
so , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . then we could go to a club . we haven ’ t been to one for ages . __eou__that ’ s a great idea . we can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . 
i see mike farmer has make it into the olympic team . he beat the national record by 0 . 1 of a second . __eou__that ’ s great . he ’ s the best runner i ’ ve seen this season . i ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the olympics . 
they use said it__eou__this city is really comfortable to living . 
it sure is__eou__no other city can match it . it 's heaven . 
oh , i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years . __eou__well , it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul . 
no , they got engaged . __eou__you must be joking . those two ?
so when did all this happen ?__eou__last weekend , while they were on the sik trip . 
some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ?__eou__they had almost every kind of seafood . there were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . i ate a lot of smoked salmon . 
yes , it probably is . i don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . you never know whether they are fresh . __eou__i know . i didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . 
not usually . i usually just order a main course and have a dessert if i ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ?
who ?__eou__my cousin monk . have you seen her lately ?
nothing exactly . she 's grown into a very attractive young lady . __eou__oh , she is . 
what do you drink ?__eou__well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you . 
of course . suit yourself . __eou__thanks . my name 's bill peters , by the way . 
i'm a student at ucla . __eou__oh , are you ? and what are you studying ?
i'm an engineer , i work for boeing . say , would you like a drink ?__eou__sure . thanks . 
would you mind taking your feet off the table , mike ?__eou__not at all . but i 've found satisfaction in it !
do you put your feet on your own table ?__eou__no , i never do that . 
well , known , jim , i'm . . . i'm pretty much in favour of your computers , i think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . __eou__but i . . . i don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . 
i ’ ve got a new boss . __eou__oh , what ’ s he like ?
kate , what do you like to do tonight ? do you often go to the movies ?__eou__of course . i often go to the movies . 
why ? to welcome the new year of course ?__eou__and also to frighten away evil spirits . 
i 'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__good . if you happen to see jim and bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
thank you very much . it ’ s very kind of you . __eou__my pleasure . 
so , how'd everyone do ?__eou__well , there 's this clock i was . . . my vintage clock ! how do you have my clock ? ?
you can put stuff on the picnic table . back to work . the grill is calling me . . . __eou__let me know if i can help . 
well , i 've grown to like second-hand things . i wouldn't have gotten through university without them !__eou__there aren't many places that sell used things in taiwan , besides auction websites . 
thanks a lot . __eou__do you work in shanghai ?
yes i do . how about you ?__eou__no , i'm a tourist . this place is amazing ! it 's much bigger than i imagined , and much more exciting ! there 's so much to see here .

sounds like an italian name with an “ i ” at the end . __eou__admit it . you just think of mussolini . 
welcome ! welcome to little italy . we 're the most italian family here !__eou__so i 've heard . that 's why i'm having such a great time . 
holly , i just heard some terrible news . __eou__me , too . i overheard someone say taylor has a brain tumor . 
maybe that 's why he didn't show up at the potluck . have you seen him ?__eou__no , but someone said he was in the men 's room puking . follow me !
what about birth control pills ? don't they work on italians ?__eou__ha-ha . birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . 
i was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . __eou__who , femi ? yeah , yi-jun saw her inside . 
really ? what kind of prizes ?__eou__well , i heard that last year vivian from accounting won a new car !
oooh ! one for each of the zeros in 2000 ! wow !__eou__stop making fun of me . 
i don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !__eou__oh , i see . you 're going to wear one and pretend you 're married to try to attract guys . 
he 's prejudiced , isn't he ?__eou__no . he 's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . 
how 's that ?__eou__you 'll see next week . i 'll come by one day at lunchtime . 
boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . __eou__easter 's a good day for reunions . the family goes to church together . 
and after church they come here for lunch ?__eou__yup , a big potluck buffet . and then-notice there are no children around ?
and so i bought all these books on having kids and . . . __eou__and they said you should play classical music ?
and they said you should play classical music ?__eou__how did you know ! they say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter !
but they 're just ads . . . __eou__duh . . . that 's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what 's in . plus , there are articles on new trends . . . 
these things are always oooo boring . heard any gossip ? anybody making the big bucks ?__eou__rich struck it rich in advertising . and he and cath got married and just had a child . 
sweet little lassie . yep , broke her heart when the d-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__oh ? i heard she dumped you . anyway , she 's right over there . oh , sheryl !

well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__wen ! that 's only a stereotype . like all asians are supposed to be math geniuses . i'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . 
well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? i'm in no hurry . __eou__oh , that 's so nice of you ! thank you very much . 
graduate management admission test , it contains three parts__eou__okay , this sounds a little tough , how am i supposed to practice for this ?
maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__pick-up lines don ' t work !
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that , i have heard it hurts a lot !

i was thinking about it , but i'm never able to keep my new year 's resolution . last year for example i joined a gym and only went twice . __eou__yeah i know what you mean . that 's why this year i am keeping things more simple . maybe like getting together with friends i haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work .

like for example , if i hadn ’ t studied architecture , i would have become an artist like i wanted to . __eou__i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally . 
well , you are right on that point . this is the reason that i don ’ t buy leather and i try to buy synthetic products . __eou__at least you ’ re doing your part . my contribution is to have a pet in the house that i treat like a member of the family . 
i ’ m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__you see , that ’ s what i ’ m talking about , i can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .

in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__it also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people .

well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , i know sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies .

what would you like to have in your breakfast , bread , egg or sandwiches ?__eou__bread . 
i have decided to go to tasha . __eou__by train or by plane ?

i have never tried it . __eou__then you 've got to try it . let 's go to the skating rink on thursday . 
sorry , i don't think i can . __eou__friday then . how about it ?
what do you mean sick ? it was really funny , don't you think ?__eou__it was entertaining in some ways . but in general i didn't like it . 
sure . how about monday ?__eou__hmm . i'm afraid i can't make it on monday . i 've got to fly to chicago on business . 
still clipping coupons ?__eou__it 's a good way to save money . 
is it a used one ?__eou__yes , it is . 
hey , john . nice car . __eou__thanks . i finally got rid of that old nissan that got me through college . 
what is this , the new ford ?__eou__no , it ’ s last year ’ s model . 
no , it ’ s last year ’ s model . __eou__true . how much did you pay ?

well , we ’ ve already done our part . __eou__yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . don ’ t be late picking me up . 
yeah , the air is really fresh . __eou__but it was not at all so fine yesterday .

it takes a long time to learn chinese writing . __eou__are you chinese by birth ?
does bullfight interest you much ?__eou__absolutely ! everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
yes . and you 're paul , right ? paul hill ?__eou__yes , it 's me . and you 're julie ashley . how are you ?
that 's interesting . go on !__eou__my grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . he couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . 
my grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . he couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__so he became a self-taught man ?
right . later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . when he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . __eou__in what field ?
yes , sing a song . but don ’ t sing a sad song . __eou__most of my songs are sad , sorry . 
yes ! let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . that ’ s so exciting . __eou__it ’ s expensive , too . let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead . 
how did it happen ?__eou__his car was hit by an express train . it happened at the crossing just behind his house . 
hello , lily . __eou__hello , mr . clark . you ’ re early for lunch . it ’ s only eleven o ’ clock . 
i ’ ll have the leg of lamb . __eou__and would you like salad ? the salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives . 
oh , yes , it is . thank you . i was looking for it just now . __eou__you look a bit familiar to me . i wonder if i have seen you somewhere before . 
just two blocks away , in that tall building . __eou__that ’ s it . i live there , too . i live on the sixth floor . 
oh , how interesting . and what about larry and rocky ?__eou__larry drives a truck . he drives all over the country . we hardly ever seen him . 
oh , no . rocky is a pilot . __eou__really ? where does he fly ? does he fly to other countries ?
oh , how dreadful ! i ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__luckily that was nothing serious . 
you and patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? you can tell me . __eou__engaged ?
that would be very nice . only that i ’ ll be a little late . is that ok ?__eou__sure . we ’ ll be looking forward to that day . 
like to come over to our fancy dress party ?__eou__oh shame ! i have a class tomorrow . 
well , it ’ s not like that . we just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . on top of which i am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting . . . __eou__out of hand . 
oh , parker with a p ?__eou__yes , with a p . 
yes , she is . __eou__does she teach chinese ?
i had a bad day yesterday . __eou__what happened ?
bummer , i ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ?__eou__yes , doctor william said that he could come back to work asap . 
thank you for your letter . __eou__is your waist any better ?
i hope to see you at that time again . bye . __eou__bye . 
yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little . __eou__give me regular unleaded then . i will back up . can you wash my windows for me ?
but it 's just a bar . there 's no danger . you shouldn't be so homophobic . __eou__well . . . 
hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ?__eou__sorry , i'm afraid that i 've got plans tonight . 
so , how did you become interested in it ?__eou__well , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started . 
wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . 
what happened to him then ?__eou__not much ; it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i__eou__it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 
women have often played an important role in british history . queen elizabeth i built a navy strong enough to fight off the spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , margaret thatcher transformed british__eou__she was a very controversial leader . are we going to visit the famous tower of london later ?
yes , i do . i like painters who use rather than watercolors . the colors appear richer . what do you think ?__eou__i agree . i prefer oils too . i collect landscapes , but i only have a small collection . you have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?
i know what the characters on the paintings mean . i think chinese characters look very artistic . it ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__i think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
it 's just a slogan for a famous company ; there 's nothing really special about it . __eou__i think it 's a brilliant advert ! it really grabs my attention !
i think it 's a brilliant advert ! it really grabs my attention !__eou__to each their own !
great ! i asked grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . __eou__this is gonna be a great barbecue !
not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?__eou__seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man . 
i ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . __eou__sure ! how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?
fine ! i ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . are you happy now ?__eou__it ’ s a start , but i ’ ll be happy when i see you stick to your promise !
that ’ s bogus . i don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__no , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize . 
when do you leave ?__eou__i'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . so if there 's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__it 's scary . 
xu spikes it ! wow , what a great hit ! the brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !__eou__it ’ s china ’ s service now . what a superb jump serve by li , oh , and we have a let serve . the ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . 
well . . . i told them not to come . i made a reservation just for the two of us . i thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . __eou__oh . . . why ?
of course . are you a new member here ?__eou__yes . 
alright . great . then we must get a card for you . __eou__what do you mean--a membership card ? i already have one . 
what is that they 're doing on the couch ?__eou__they 're smoking pot . don't worry about it . 
why don't you run outside ?__eou__are you kidding ? do you know how cold it is today ?
that is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine . the catholics call it the eucharist . __eou__it doesn't sound like an english word . 
i understand . but really you weren't rude at all . you said what you thought . i think he appreciates that . __eou__really ?
yes . __eou__but i am new here , and i'm not sure he is used to that . 
of course . it 's a good school . how long have you lived in taichung ?__eou__i have lived in taichung for two years now . so this is the second time i am going back to states . i go back once a year to visit my family . 
is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the u . s . ?__eou__yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything . now we have the right to sell in america at a much lower tariff . it ' s going to be good . we can compete more directly with them . 
wait , jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . put a hat on !__eou__ok . bye !
relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__you know what ? i don ’ t think i can hack it here out in the countryside . i ’ m going back to the city !
did you read this ? it says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__why would that be funny ?
wow ! you must have been pretty far away from the city . __eou__yeah , my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? i ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . __eou__i could try , but i can ’ t say for sure if i ’ ll get up in time . what time do you want to go ?
i could try , but i can ’ t say for sure if i ’ ll get up in time . what time do you want to go ?__eou__i ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty . 
o . k . , maybe if i have someone to go with , i ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . __eou__great , i ’ ll see you then . 
maurice richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !__eou__alright , the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can ’ t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores . 
how was your business trip ?__eou__great - they wined and dined us all week . 
yes , of course . didn't you know that ?__eou__no , i didn't . how high is the tax ?
well , it is different in different countries . but it 's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?
why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?__eou__liquor is considered a luxury item . and also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy . so if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . 
hectic . it 's always hectic . but how was your windsurfing ?__eou__i tried it for a half-hour . it was interesting , but . . . well . . . i couldn't really do it . 
the guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . __eou__i can't see him . where ?
yes , it 's mel gibson . __eou__oh , wow ! it 's really him ! who is that woman he 's with ?
what ? you feel sorry for the butterflies ?__eou__yes . i think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . it is a kind of destruction of nature . 
this one is 2300 dollars . maybe i should buy it for my mother . what do you think ?__eou__if you want . didn't you buy her a small vase already ?
slot machines ? no , i don't want that ! that 's too boring . i want a game with cards or dice . __eou__so what do you want to play then ?
he ’ s the love of my life ! i ’ ve really messed this up . __eou__come on , hon . pull yourself together . it ’ s going to be alright . 
son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys . they ’ re dangerous !__eou__no , fireworks are awesome !
whoa , don ’ t you remember ? last year when i set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ?__eou__i was scared because . . . because i saw a bug . that ’ s all . 
exactly ! i ’ m going to cut out all that junk i eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . __eou__i ’ ve heard this one before . 
oh , no ! i ’ m so sorry ! are you all right ?__eou__oh . . . i don ’ t know . 
what do you want to do tomorrow night ?__eou__what--is tomorrow night something special ?
yes ? why not ?__eou__alright . at least that 's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . 
no , maybe they 're not . but they 're close . __eou__so where should we go ?
that 's right . after their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or english . they are very serious about learning over there . __eou__hmm . that sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . don't they ever relax ?
are the kids in taiwan very obedient ?__eou__that 's a stereotype we americans have . we think that asian kids are very obedient and quiet . but it 's not true . there are plenty of naughty kids too . 
i agree . and probably the automobile companies are too powerful . they never allowed the government to develop trains . __eou__it 's too bad for the environment . so much pollution from cars . 
because the earth 's environment can't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . __eou__maybe you 're right . they will have to develop alternative transportation . but it will be hard in america . too many people are used to cars . even in our movies cars are very important . 
is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?__eou__there are several good clubs near the city centre . many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
awful . it was a complete waste of time . __eou__why ? what was it about ?
yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__lt sounds like the story of my life . 
sure is . waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ah hah . thought you were't drinking . 
yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc . . . __eou__is everything ready now ?
i 've actually never tired . do you have a surfboard ?__eou__we 've got a few . i can teach you how to surf on sunday . it 'll be fun !
shall we keep our friendship ?__eou__sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
so , how did you become interested in it ?__eou__well , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started . 
what time is it going to start ?__eou__most people are working friday night , so it 's going to start around 9 pm . 
should i bring anything ?__eou__we 'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . 
hi , chary , are you busy this evening ?__eou__sorry , i'm afraid that i 've got plans tonight . 
what 's wrong ?__eou__well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . 
in the long run , i think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but i know that i 'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . __eou__relationships can be confusing sometimes . 
have you ever been camping in the boundary waters ?__eou__no , but i 've always wanted to do that . i 've heard it 's a beautiful place to go . 
that'd be great . what time should i meet you there ?__eou__how about at 11:00 ?
i didn't know you were scared of heights ! was it really bad ?__eou__let me put it this way . i 've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because i could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . 
of course i was scared . but i had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__so have you cured your fear of heights ?
are you sure you don't need any help ?__eou__well , maybe just a little . i can't seem to make it fit . 
the weather is so warm for december , don't you think ?__eou__it is unusually warm . i blame it on global warming . 
i got rid of that clunker . this is my new one . __eou__is that right ? it sure beats the old one ?
yeah , it costed a bundle alright . __eou__wow , this 's sinking a hole . 
have you talk to him about it ?__eou__not yet , but i have to soon . he 's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night
this feels great . i'm all reed up . i can keep going all night . __eou__not me . i'm too hot and i'm too tired . 
i decided to put him up while he 's here , big mistake !__eou__why ?
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ?__eou__no idea . we 've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . what else is there to see ?
yes . i heard there 's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . we can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__good idea ! i 've always been interested in that . how much is the entrance fee ?
i believe most of them think of it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__oh , i see . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
i think it 's either one or two gigs . i can't remember . __eou__how much do they cost ?
would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ?__eou__sure . i'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . 
what 's up ?__eou__not much . i'm just trying to hook up to the internet . i'm having a few problems though . 
i hook up to the internet every day . i can't believe i didn't do that . __eou__do you like ever chat online ?
you wouldn't believe what i got in the mail today !__eou__what 's that ?
oh . it 's actually all rather personal . __eou__well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . 
didn't i tell you ? we 're going to shanghai to stay with them in june . __eou__oh , i guess i missed that . 
oh , i guess i missed that . __eou__men !
that 's really convenient . does it have the bluetooth ?__eou__yes , but i don't really use it that often . have you ever used it ?
yes , but i don't really use it that often . have you ever used it ?__eou__no , but i think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
does it have a camera ?__eou__of course it does . doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ?
sure . here you go . __eou__have you checked your voicemail recently ?
the rubik 's cube is so difficult to solve that i think it should be banned !__eou__if i taught you how to do it , i'm sure you could solve it . 
i didn't really have to figure it out . i just followed the instructions !__eou__i had no idea there were a set of instructions . i thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !
yeah . that was a strange party . can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ?__eou__i don't know . i haven't tried yo-yo since that party !
first of all , i want you to know that i really like working for this company . do you think i'm doing a good job here ?__eou__well , you are a very hard-worker . 
that sounds good to me . i really appreciate it . __eou__you are welcome . come in early tomorrow and i 'll show you how to do the scheduling . 
you 're right ! how are you ? it 's been a long time !__eou__what did you do after high school ?
what did you do after high school ?__eou__i went straight to university afterwards . what about you ?
that 's good advice . __eou__would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?__eou__are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here . . . yes , there 's one left . __eou__ok . i 'll take that one then . 
when is the first meeting then ?__eou__they 've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . that should give you enough time to have a quick shower . 
i guess if i only have a few days , i should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . __eou__since the may holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here ’ s the phone number . 
no , i haven't had a chance to . but i 've been watching a chinese tv series called chinese-style divorce . __eou__oh , really ? i saw it two years ago . it 's worth seeing and it 's thought-provoking . 
let me guess , your parents want you to marry a chinese man , right ?__eou__you are right . it is giving me a real headache . i feel like i ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
okay , let me think . what about a party-and-movie night ? we can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . __eou__sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . 
well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly i chat online . you could say i'm addicted to online chatting . __eou__i never chatted online before . what 's it like . 
i never chatted online before . what 's it like . __eou__well , basically it 's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . you should try it at least once . 
i have an offer to work for a company in your city today ?__eou__i can't believe it ! is it real ? you 're moving here ?
oh really , frank ? what kind of movies do you like ?__eou__actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . how about you ?
actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . how about you ?__eou__art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . 
really impressive . these two genres are totally different . __eou__sure . i enjoy both of them very much . 
what 's the puzzle ?__eou__my husband and i prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
are they window seats or aisle seats ?__eou__let me see . . . yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . 
was it that crowded ?__eou__yes . there were always so many people . after taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . 
fine , thank you , sir . it ’ s nice to see you again . __eou__good to see you again , too . how ’ s you family ?
how have you been ?__eou__i'm pretty good . i 've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i don't want to renew it . 
she 's probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__i 've given her enough time . i'm over it now . 
she 's a friend of amy . we met at amy 's birthday party . __eou__is this your first date ?
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ?__eou__i don't think dieting is good for you . it 's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some seat or you 'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ?
are you sure she was trying to put you down ?__eou__of course , i am sure . 
you shall go easy on her . she is new here . __eou__just how am i supposed to do that ?
i am not . she is no picnic . __eou__well . if you think i can help , let me know . 
yes . my family lives in rural korea , near pusan . we have a huge house . the first floor of the house is a part-time private school . in the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , englis__eou__wow ! you grew up in a school ! no wonder your english is excellent !
you are right , i guess . the world keeps changing , and so do families . but i like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . that 's what i want . __eou__it is good to have goals in life . if california doesn't work out , come and visit me in korea , ok ?
i 've been studying hard for my examinations . and you ?__eou__i 've been learning japanese every evening . 
i wish i could . but i'm afraid i can't . i 've got some serious studying to do . i have to go . __eou__ok . see you on today . 
things couldn't be better . where are you going now ?__eou__i am heading for the library . i 've got a research project to do . how about you ?
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . come down for a vacation sometime . i ’ ll take you to disney world . __eou__that sounds great ! i ’ ll take you up on that invitation . 
here ’ s my business card . send me an email once in a while . __eou__count on it . and here ’ s my card . don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . 
i will . good-bye . __eou__bye-bye !
no , they have a big new fancy house . __eou__does jim make a lot of money ?
look at the girls in the street . they all have bunch of flowers . is it valentine 's day ?__eou__oh , yes ! i completely forgot about it . 
what did you think of the movie ?__eou__i didn't like it . not a bit . i couldn't stand the music . besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep . 
if i won the pools , i'd go round the world . __eou__would you ? i wouldn't .

are you good at making decisions ?__eou__not really . sometimes , i even let other people make key decision for me . 
you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . __eou__i ’ m worried that what i say will not make sense . 
i heard that janet has got a new job . she ’ s working for the united investment group . i hear that they pay very well . __eou__i heard that too . she must be making a pocket . well , good for her . 
there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?__eou__i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late .

not a good plan . the tv weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__what a nuisance ! every time i plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . the sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops . well , i'd better stay home . 
he put it out and flew back to the airport . then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . __eou__did you land safely ?

what ? you 've got to be kidding me !__eou__i wish i were , but i am deadly serious . she said you invited her to dinner last week . 
we don't think so . casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__i guess it lets people express their individual tastes . but won't some people abuse it ?
we may travel by sea . __eou__it ’ s cheaper , isn ’ t it ?
i left a suitcase on the train to london the other day . __eou__can you describe it , sir ?

what 's so interesting about it ?__eou__well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
what kind of magazine is it ?__eou__it 's instructive and inspiring . 
mom , i didn ’ t have breast . i could eat a horse . __eou__dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can . 
yeah . how about “ happy birthday tony , from the gang . ”__eou__i ’ m on it !
so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ?__eou__to be honest , i don't really care for either one .

i didn't see the crash itself , but i did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . __eou__that must have been horrible . did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?
i'd believe it . she owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . __eou__you know ; i heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in africa . 
i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
i never really give them money because i don't want to contribute to their addictions . __eou__homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . do you do anything to help them ?
sure , i'd love to meet the cast ! have you ever been in a play ?__eou__i 've never had a part in a play before , but i used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
that 's a good point . i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__you have to give them credit , though . it 's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . 
sure . you know it has an online edition , too . you should go online to read if you want to read it now . __eou__that 's ok . i 'll wait until you 're finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
it 's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . __eou__are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
it 's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it 's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
what 's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?__eou__it 's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there 's a chance of freezing rain . 
yes , i 've read them many times . i think it 's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .

decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . __eou__of course . generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . 
professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome .

in addition to your major , did you have other fields to study ?__eou__yes , i had taken finance courses in a training school . compound talents are needed in the society and i must study continually to keep abreast with the times .

how much are you asking for this ?__eou__i'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . is that all right ?
are you ready to move ?__eou__definitely . i ve got the hell out of the company . anything new ?

why do i have to hire you ?__eou__i have a proven track record in resolving problems , multitasking , and dealing with customers , as you can sec in my resume . i think it is enough . 
that 's right . details can mean succeed or fail . __eou__when talking you should focus your eyes on the interviewer in order to closely watch his or her expressions . 
never should you give an answer completely beside the point . __eou__if you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . 
try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . __eou__it can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . 
working conditions are very relaxed . you may work whatever hours you want , provided you get your job done properly . __eou__i like flexible hours . 
usually , you cannot prepare for these questions in advance and have to depend on your immediate performance . __eou__still , there are some rules to follow . 
if you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . the tuition fee will be financed by our company . __eou__really ? it is amazing . i will apply for a position in your company .

don't forget to say " thank you " when you take a seat . __eou__make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . 
make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . __eou__you can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . 
how will you solve the problem ?__eou__the company will assign you housing subsidies at 400 yuan a month . 
when the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief . __eou__still , you should not let down your guard . some details should be paid attention to . 
how about the lunch break , lucy ?__eou__from 11:30 to 1 o ’ clock . 
do you give me a bonus ?__eou__yes . we don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer semi-annual bonuses . 
only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . __eou__to sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . 
it should also be truthful and realistic . do not blindly blow your own horn . __eou__you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . 
what does the contact information include ?__eou__such as your land line phone number , mobile phone number and e-mail box . 
anything else ?__eou__then you should write your objectives , such as seeking a position in foreign trade . 
i see . skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . but what about related experience ? i have little work experience . __eou__don't worry . it will take time to accumulate experience . you need to be confident for yourself . 
i think so , but how should we write it ?__eou__i think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal . 
oh , you have recommended yourself very well . i should think about how to recommend myself as well . __eou__you can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in english .

is ms april wang available at the moment ?__eou__i'm sorry , sir . she 's currently away at our sub-branch . is there anything i can help you with ?
yes , i did indeed . but , could you tell me what exactly the ' priority service room ' is used for ?__eou__of course . as we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . 
there 's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates . . . __eou__the list goes on and on !
i need some info on car loans . such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__certainly . do you currently bank with us ?
that 's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . that 's why we have just started a new scheme ; a personal automobile consumer loan . __eou__great , i just hope i qualify ! could you tell me some more ? can i use the money to buy the car from anywhere ?
may i ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? most young people jump at the chance . __eou__when i opened the account with you , i was a student , i graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so i figured now would be the best time to go ahead . 
welcome to the consultancy department , i'm greg wu . what can i assist you with today ?__eou__i need to do a credit investigation on another company , but i'm worried it 'll be a bit difficult . 
certainly . . . __eou__ok , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . 
i think so . __eou__we will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address . . . 
good morning , sir . can i help you with something ?__eou__i hope so . i'm not actually a customer here , but i saw an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper about your new bank card . 
that 's right . but don't worry ; it 's a very simple procedure . __eou__could i open an account with you today ?
sorry , i'm not quite sure if i understand . in what way , sir ? has your card been stolen ?__eou__no , no . nothing at all like that . it 's just that i applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but i'm still waiting for my card . 
mmmm . . . if i come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way i could use it today ? petty cash is getting low , so i need to draw some money . __eou__as long as you bring your id , etc , we can serve you over the counter . but you won't be able to use the atm until your new pin number arrives . 
how much would you like to withdraw ?__eou__is it ok to withdraw usd ?
no problem , sir . he 'll be with you in just a minute . could i get you something to drink while you are waiting ?__eou__a black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks . 
i see . we offer personal housing loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0 . 42 % per month . __eou__that 's pretty much the same as i 've been quoted at other banks . 
then we can certainly help you with that . you see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate . __eou__mmmm . . . that does sound interesting . is there anyone available i can talk with about this in more detail ?
i see . what does it entail ? i'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__this loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . 
ok , that 's absolutely fine . i will need to see some credentials before we can get started . do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ?__eou__yes , yes . it 's all here . there you go . i'm not sure if i need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do i ?
you ’ ll be okay . __eou__thanks for telling me . 
will you be voting this year ?__eou__of course ! will you ?
i ’ m not sure what i ’ m doing . __eou__voting is easy . 
nobody told me that before . __eou__you have nothing to worry about . 
i just got done voting . __eou__this was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ?
i just turned 18 last month . __eou__that is so lucky of you . 
that is so lucky of you . __eou__why ?
why is that ?__eou__you turned 18 in an election year . 
you turned 18 in an election year . __eou__i didn ’ t think about it like that . 
you ’ re lucky . __eou__what do you mean ?
of course !__eou__who was your vote for president ?
my name is alice lin , and i need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . __eou__just one second , and i 'll check . 
you know i did . __eou__who did you vote for ?
just look at the screen here . it 'll give you prompts , you see ? now you need to enter your pin number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . __eou__then it 'll give me my money ?
i'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately i 've lost my card !__eou__calm down , sir . is that an iba debit or credit card ?
i'm mike kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . i'm not sure what they are . __eou__that should be fine , mr kowalski . and your pin number ?
that 's great . we 'll also need details of your occupation . __eou__i have all of that with me . i 've also banked here for a number of years . 
ok , as i expected . how much will you allow me to borrow ? i mean , i don't need a massive sum of money . __eou__you are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 rib , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . 
how soon before this goes through ?__eou__if you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . 
i already have some time deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . i really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__i understand completely . there are other options , such as a personal pledge loan . 
the initial amount is just 2,000 rib , but we can go up to 100,000 rib . but remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . __eou__ok . i 'll have a look at what i 've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . thanks for your help . bye . 
ok . i 'll have a look at what i 've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . thanks for your help . bye . __eou__my pleasure , sir . bye . 
not a problem . which loan was it you were interested in ? sorry , i must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__i understand . i'm interested in the petty consumer loan . 
so , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the pbc ?__eou__that is correct . 
i can ’ t vote on tuesday . __eou__what ’ s the reason for that ?
i have to go to work . __eou__you can just go to work after you vote . 
may i help you ?__eou__i ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot . 
just take it to a booth and begin voting . __eou__sounds good . thanks .

that ’ s interesting . __eou__i enjoy working there every year . 
i enjoy working there every year . __eou__how much do they pay ?

how much money are you looking to make ?__eou__as much as we can . 
like what ?__eou__you can always wash cars and sell candy . 
if you don ’ t like that , then you ’ re probably going to be mad at what i tell you next . __eou__more bad news ?
what would you like to ask me ?__eou__what is your stand on gay marriage ?
what is your stand on gay marriage ?__eou__i feel that people can love who they want .

when he pulled out the gun , i got so scared . __eou__tell me what else happened . 
he got the money and tried to leave . __eou__did the cops get him ?
you have a warrant out for your arrest . __eou__i don't have a warrant . 
i was never told to go to court . __eou__there 's nothing i can do about that . 
that 's life . __eou__what about my rights ?
he was by himself . __eou__would you come down to the station for further questioning ?

they made you spend the night at the station ?__eou__yes , they did .

i don ’ t understand . __eou__there was no reason for them to arrest me . 
there was no reason for them to arrest me . __eou__they let you go , didn ’ t they ?
they said i matched the description of a robber . __eou__i get it now . 
well , some people decided to loot last night . __eou__i don't understand . 
a bunch of people went looting last night . __eou__they what ?

about two hours ago . __eou__why didn't you report it before ?
i know . i was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . __eou__you should never open a door without looking to see who it is .

hello , daniel . what can i do for you ?__eou__i'm calling to notify you that an export l / c has arrived for you . 
don't worry . you can draw your money at any time . but you 'll not receive the time deposit return of interest . what we can offer is a current one . __eou__i see . by the way , what if i forget to cash my money when the maturity comes ?
in that case , we 'll just regard your account as a regular savings account from then on . __eou__i see . 
we are going to macau to visit my niece . she said it 's better for me to bring us dollars , is that right ?__eou__that is one option , madam . if your are travelling to either hong kong or macau we are permitted to exchange up to 1,000 usd for you . 
to be honest , i have no idea about these things ! but i'm sure that 's alright . __eou__yes , it 's not bad . i will need to see your passport though . 
group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . __eou__i see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . interesting . . . 
you 're pretty lucky actually , today is higher than yesterday . it 's 824 . 71 rib for 100 usd . __eou__great ! do you need me to sign anything ?
what can i do for you today ?__eou__it 's a little embarrassing really ; you see i think i 've got a counterfeit note . 
do you remember where you got it ?__eou__no , i don't . usually i'm very careful about checking the money i'm given , but for some reason this one slipped through . 
i see . here 's my bank book . __eou__you need to fill out the deposit slip as well . here you go , madam . 
arm . . . just the usual , current deposit please . __eou__ok , just a moment . i 'll find the relevant data and help you with that .

yes , right here . __eou__great . please fill them out on this deposit slip . 
yes , but the problem is that i have a savings account with you , and i need to take some money from that . do i really have to give 90 days notice if i want my money ?__eou__actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal . 
after you 've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . __eou__miao ping , if i do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if i exceed be counted ?
so , if i do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a corporate agreement savings plan with you ?__eou__first of all , you need to sign a corporate agreement savings contract with us . this means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . 
you want to withdraw on your time deposit , right ?__eou__that 's correct . but before i do , i was wondering if you could give me some advice . 
hello . i'd like to open a foreign currency account . __eou__i see . well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . there are 7 to choose from

yes , that 's right . __eou__i just need to see some identification before i hand over the cash . 
you 're here to make a deposit , is that correct ?__eou__right . i'd like to deposit 2,000 rib into my current account . 
no problem . could i have the cash and your bank book , please ? oh dear . . . there seems to be some problems here . . . __eou__what ? what 's wrong ?

2,000 ad $ . __eou__which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
what is the difference between them ?__eou__the cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .

now , you can do it via our atms . it 's convenient and easy to use . and we have 4 machines in this branch , so the queues are not usually very long . __eou__so , how do i use it ?
okay , i see the problem . you forgot your code , didn't you ?__eou__how did you know ?
the machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it . __eou__oh . but can i have my card back now ?

oh great ! we 've been waiting for those . is everything alright with them ?__eou__actually , there is a problem . it 's the goods description , it 's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes .

yes , you can have a money link card . you can also base the account on time deposits . the choice is yours . __eou__how about the interest ? i'm not really happy with the interest i'm receiving through my current account . 
the interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our personal financing . __eou__that sounds better . also , can i use the one card for several accounts ? say , if i have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ?
tina li , financial planner , how may i be of service ?__eou__hello , tina . an acquaintance of mine has just told me that your bank has started a new personal wealth management service . is that right ?
of course . financing link is a value-added service , and can be tailored to suit your requirements . __eou__so , i can choose exactly what services i require ? that 's brilliant . can i use the card if i'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ?
so , i can choose exactly what services i require ? that 's brilliant . can i use the card if i'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ?__eou__certainly . we can arrange the structure to suit whatever you require . that 's why this service is so popular ; it 's suitable for everyone because we make it that way .

of course , that 's all part of the service . __eou__thank you . i don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure . . . 
it 's nx567822100007 . __eou__hang on a tick and i 'll check for you . i'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving . 
hello , this is quinn from iba . __eou__ah , hello quinn . oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
i'm afraid so , yes . __eou__hmm . . . well , it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . __eou__i trust your judgement . thank you , quinn . i 'll be back tomorrow with a new set . bye for now . 
that 's great ! that was quick , after it not being there yesterday i wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while . __eou__well , it 's here now . shall we credit that straight to your account ?
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about a loan i want to make . __eou__sure . by all means please do . please take a seat . 
of course . __eou__i'd like to change these dollars into rib . would you please tell me the exchange rate between american dollar and rib ?
do you want an international money order or a banker 's draft ?__eou__i'd like a banker 's draft please . it 's not really urgent . 
that 's good . is there anything else ?__eou__no . that 's all . you have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . 
well , i want to change 1000 australian dollars for rib . __eou__okay . please sign here in this form . 
1 % ? that ’ s too low a rate . could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__i ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . 
i'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . 
but you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . when they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__i don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . 
welcome to china , mr . white . __eou__how do you do , ms . chi ?
thank you , ms chi . what are your normal export terms ?__eou__we normally export cfr . 
we shall open an irrevocable l / c to cover our shipment from shanghai to hamburg . is it at sight or after sight ?__eou__at sight of course . 
at sight of course . __eou__some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . 
but such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . other suppliers are offering better terms . some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__we ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . you don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . the usual percentage is around 85 . 
yes . we usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__if you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . 
what 's your last word as to the date then ?__eou__i said by the middle of oct . this is the best we can promise .

what is the interest rate on your card ?__eou__the annual charge rate is 9 . 5 % . 
the annual charge rate is 9 . 5 % . __eou__that 's very expensive !
you mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__no , madam . not very much .

certainly . no one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible . 
could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible . __eou__right . here is our sales catalog and literature . 
we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . but our suggestion to you , mr . bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market . . . __eou__do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?

forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . you should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__i am sorry about the quality problem , but i propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
