sample:
so glad to meet you . 
how is everything going on ? 
you 're kidding ! 

sample:
me too . recently , fascinated with net-chat . i 've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them . i really enjoy it . 
you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
i thought you were a little more than you . 

sample:
you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
afraid not . every coin has two sides . i think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . 
i think so .

sample:
let ’ s meet in front of the train station . 
ok great , i ’ ll see you at six . 
i ’ m sorry . i ’ m not sure . 

sample:

now that i look back at it , it that big a deal . i have lost my temper . 
i .

i ’ m going to get a new job . 

sample:
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ? 
no idea . we 've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . what else is there to see ? 
i want to be there . 

sample:
i believe most of them think it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
oh , isee . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
i agree with you . you ’ ve been a lot of people in the country in the country . 

sample:
great . i hung out with jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . 
sounds a good weekend . you know it always me that two people as different as you and jo can become such close friends . 
what about ? 

sample:
well , that 's something i 've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty . 
i agree . you expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
you are a bit young . you should be a little more more more more than a job . 

sample:
what time are you leaving ? 
1:30 p . m . but i 've got to check in at 12:30 p . m .

rough . maybe you can do the most of the talking . 
i . 

sample:
do you feel better ? 
much better . my heart sank when mary told me that she wanted to leave me . 
yes . i like it very much . 

sample:
you are right . they sweep nancy off her feet . and now she fell head over heels in love with him . 
how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles ! 
i thought he was a bit more than a girl . 

sample:
yes that might be a better idea . 
maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . 
i think you should get a little more more than a while . 

sample:
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good . 
no , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . 
yes , but it is . 

sample:
well , everything is packed and ready to go . 
it 's hard to believe that we 're really leaving . the past two weeks was like a dream . 
i thought that i was thinking about that . 

sample:
yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . 
do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? 
i thought that she was a little . 

sample:
my pleasure . what a pity you have to leave so soon ! 
we would stay longer . but i 've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . thank you for your warm hospitality . 
i thought you were a little tired .

he has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . 
poor guy ! it will take him a long time to get back on his feet . 
he is . he very well . 

sample:

i didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . 
i thought that i was thinking about it . 

sample:
yes , i should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . 
wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . 
i ’ m sure you ’ ll be able to get a little more more than a while . 

sample:
yes , i ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . 
well have a good time . get me some autographs if you can . 
i don ’ t think so . 

sample:
i decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must .

is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ? 
i think you 're right . 

sample:
well , brad from school asked me out just today . 
brad bush ? good for you ! 
i thought you were a little . 

sample:
i think polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
oh , i think you 're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
you think you 'll be able to do it . 

sample:
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness ? 
well , there are certain factors that effect people 's size and weight . 
yes , they are . 

sample:
why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? 
that sounds good but i don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
i ’ m going to be a little bit more . 

sample:
that sounds good but i don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
i think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring hugh grant . let ’ s go and see that . 
you ’ re going to be a little more more than a job . 

sample:
you can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . 
i have the heart to do that . 
he is . he very well . 

sample:
every country should face the history . 
yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . we have traditional values and long but different history . 
i think so . 

sample:
yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . we have traditional values and long but different history . 
sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . 
i don ’ t think so . 

sample:
well i wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . 
oh i see . so what did you do then ? 
i thought it was a little . 

sample:
he ’ s fine . he retired last week . it ’ s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
he can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
he ’ s a bit more than a man . 

sample:
almost two years ? your english is very good . 
thank you . but there 's still a lot for me to learn . 
yes . i am . i am busy the company is very well . 

sample:
i think we 've met . 
no , i think we have . 
i . 

sample:
oh yes , i ’ ve been to britain many times . i go there on business . 
really ? how often do you go there ? 
what ? 

sample:
what a good day ! 
yes . it 's really wonderful here the grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . 
i was in the mood . 

sample:
what about tomorrow ? are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
no , i haven ’ t got any plans . 
i ’ m going to be a little bit bit . 

sample:
it 's probably jet lag . 
i think so . one minute i feel quite awake , and the next i feel very tired . 
i . 

sample:
do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? 
oh yes , very interested in chinese history so i ’ d like to visit the summer palace . 
yes . 

sample:
yeah , most of the people are from our office . 
sounds like missing out on a good time . oh , well , there is always next year . 
what about ? 

sample:
the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ? 
yes . you always have a good nose for wines . 
yes , but i have been thinking about it . 

sample:
wow ! is it a good car ? 
it ’ s a great car . it ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . 
it 's a little . 

sample:
was it expensive ? 
put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . 
yes . 

sample:
yes , of course . i go through a day without coffee in the morning . 
me too , but i think we drink too much of it , as it 's not very healthy . 
what ? 

sample:
but i also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction 
i think so . coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . 
i agree . but i think it is a good idea . 

sample:
you may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . 
maybe i could have a try . 
thank . 

sample:
well , i know . 
let me tell you the story . in 1892 , patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called ' good morning to you ' . but later someone added the words ' happy birthday ' to their tune

sample:
no , once i fill the tub with beer , i 'll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better . 
i think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . it 's appetizing and tasty . 
thank .

i like it very much . 

sample:

sample:

i can leave the parcel with you , i ? 
what ? 

sample:

sample:
no . i don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . the man in the other car made a big mistake . 
you mean tony is the victim ? no , i don ’ t think so . he ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
i ’ m sure you ’ ll be able to get up . 

sample:
mary has really gotten under my skin . 
i know what love it . when i was young , i felt the same way . 
what ? 

sample:
but it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . 
you are right . 
i think that the government should be done .

but he has suffered a lot . 
he is . he a very good fan .

are your vegetables a little mushy ? 
i think so . 

sample:
thank you . i just got these shoes today . 
really ? what kind of shoes are they ? 
what ? 

sample:
i believe that 10 % is just about right amount . 
i think that a tip of $ 3 . 60 will be the right amount to leave . 
well , we can get some more than that .

no , i . 
she 's really pretty . 
you 're kidding .

sample:
no , but that was a random change of subject . 
it may have been random , but have you ?

this waitress has really been on top of things , she ? 
i think it 's not . 

sample:
let 's take a look at our bill . the total price for our dinner is $ 36 . 00 . 
how much money should we leave for a tip ? 
i think we can get a little more than a few minutes . 

sample:
no thanks . we just need our check . have you seen the waitress ? 
oh , here comes our waitress with our check . 
yes . i have a good time . 

sample:
usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . i am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . 
i agree that 20 % would be just about right . 
i think that the price of the products are usually in the country . 

sample:
i agree that 20 % would be just about right . 
ok , so that will bring her tip to $ 7 . 20 . add it to the $ 36 . 00 and the total is $ 43 . 20 . 
that sounds good . 

sample:
yes , what a nice dinner that was ! 
we 'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .

sure , we do . 
how long does it usually take you to make delivery ? 
i want to pay my wife . 

sample:
let 's look at that another way . the major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . 
what are you thinking about ? 
i agree . 

sample:
but our order this time is very large . to open an l / c for such a large amount at a bank is costly . can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? 
afraid not . we insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . 
yes , i think so . i think i 'll have a look at it .

my stomach is bothering me . 
i was in the morning .

i had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . 
maybe the food had something wrong with it .
